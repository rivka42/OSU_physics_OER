			Vectors do not multiply in the same way as scalars due to their inherent directionality.  
			One way to multiply vectors is the <em>dot product</em>, 
			named because you will use a dot to represent the multiplication. 
			The dot product of two vectors is itself a <alert>scalar</alert> value, not a new vector.

<title>The Dot Product</title>
<statement>
	<p>
		
	</p>
<p>The dot product between two vectors is given by <m>\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = AB \cos\theta</m>, 
where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the vectors when placed tail-to-tail.</p>

    </figure>
    
<p>
Here, <m> \theta</m> represents the angle between the two vectors when they are placed tail to tail. A and B represent the magnitudes of the vectors <m> \vec{A}</m> and <m> \vec{B}</m>.
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, the dot product quantifies how much of one vector is in the same direction as another vector, or how parallel two vectors are. The dot product is the magnitude of <m> \vec{B}</m> multiplied by the projection of  <m> \vec{A}</m> along <m> \vec{B}</m>. You can think of a projection as the length of the shadow that <m> \vec{A}</m> would cast on <m> \vec{B}</m> if you were to shine a light from above.
</p>

<note>
	<title>Vector Algebra for the Dot Product</title>
	
	<p>
		Though you are less likely to calculate the dot product algebraically in physics, 
		you can do so by multiplying like components and then adding the resulting products together.

<mrow> \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} \amp = (A_x \hat{x} + A_y \hat{y}+ A_z\hat{z}) \cdot (B_x \hat{x} + B_y \hat{y}+ B_z\hat{z})</mrow>
<mrow> \amp = A_xB_x(\hat{x} \cdot \hat{x}) + A_yB_y(\hat{y} \cdot \hat{y}) + A_zB_z (\hat{z} \cdot \hat{z}) </mrow>
<mrow>\amp = A_xB_x + A_yB_y+A_zB_z </mrow>
</md>
 
 Recall: <m>\hat{x} \cdot \hat{x} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{z} \cdot \hat{z} = 1</m>
