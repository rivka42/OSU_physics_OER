Vectors do not multiply in the same way as scalars due to their inherent directionality.  One way to multiply vectors is the <em>dot product</em>, named because you will use a dot to represent the multiplication. The dot product of two vectors is itself a <alert>scalar</alert> value, not a new vector.

<title>The Dot Product</title>
<statement>
<p>The dot product between two vectors is given by <m>\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = AB sin\theta</m>, where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the vectors when placed tail-to-tail.</p>
</statement>
</definition>

    </figure>
    
<p>
Here, <m> \theta</m> represents the angle between the two vectors when they are placed tail to tail. A and B represent the magnitude of the vectors <m> \vec{A}</m> and <m> \vec{B}</m>.
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, the dot product quantifies how much of one vector is in the same direction as another vector, or how parallel two vectors are. The dot product is the magnitude of <m> \vec{B}</m> multiplied by the projection of  <m> \vec{A}</m> along <m> \vec{B}</m>. You can think of a projection as the length of the shadow that <m> \vec{A}</m> would cast on <m> \vec{B}</m> if you were to shine a light from above.
</p>

<insight>
<p>
Many physical quantities (work, torque, angular momentum) depend on how parallel or how perpendicular two vector quantities are with respect to each other. The underlying conceptual framework of what a dot product tells us about nature is geometric. In this class you will be exploring many situations which will require us to build our geometric reasoning skills.
