  <title>Vector Algebra</title>

<p>
Representing vectors as arrows is a good way to get a geometric understanding and also for creating a good physics diagram of a physical situation you are interested in understanding. However, if you want to quantify the physics, you need to work algebraically within a particular coordinate system. Consider the vector <m>\vec{A}</m> written in terms of components and the unit vectors <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m>, and <m> \hat{z} </m>
</p>

<me>
\vec{A} = a_x\hat{x}+a_y\hat{y}+a_z\hat{z}
</me>
    
 <p>
Now you can <em>algebraically</em> compute the vector operations you learned previously!  For example, to multiply a vector by a scalar algebraically, you multiply each component by the scalar separately.
 </p>
 
 <me>
 a\vec{A} = (aA_x)\hat{x} + (aA_y)\hat{y} + (aA_z)\hat{z}
 </me>

 <title> Vector Addition and Subtraction</title>

  <p></p>

<p>
To add vectors that are written in terms of components algebraically, you add the components (<m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>, for example) for the two vectors separately.
</p>

<md>
<mrow> \vec{A} + \vec{B} \amp = (A_x \hat{x} + A_y \hat{y}+ A_z\hat{z}) + (B_x \hat{x} + B_y \hat{y}+ B_z\hat{z}) </mrow>
<mrow> \amp = (A_x +B_x)\hat{x} + (A_y + B_y)\hat{y} + (A_z+B_z) \hat{z}</mrow>
</md>


 <p></p>
 
 <p>
Similarly, to subtract vectors algebraically, you subtract like components.
</p>
 
 <md>
<mrow> \vec{A} - \vec{B} \amp = (A_x \hat{x} + A_y \hat{y}+ A_z\hat{z}) - (B_x \hat{x} + B_y \hat{y}+ B_z\hat{z}) </mrow>
<mrow> \amp = (A_x - B_x)\hat{x} + (A_y - B_y)\hat{y} + (A_z - B_z) \hat{z} </mrow>
</md>
</axiom>


 
<!-- Omitted for brevity
 <p>
 This concludes our chapter on vectors. Understanding vector operations is fundamental to all of physics. It is of utmost importance that you learn to use multiple representations of vectors (diagrams, graphs, words, equations) and be able to move back and forth between those representations.
