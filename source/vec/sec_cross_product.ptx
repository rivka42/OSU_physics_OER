In a previous section you learned about the dot product as one way to multiply vectors.  Another way to multiply vectors is the <em>cross product</em>, named because you will use <m>\times</m> to represent the multiplication. Unlike the dot product, the cross product of two vectors is a <alert>vector</alert>, not a scalar.
</p>

<definition >
<title>The Cross Product</title>
<statement>
	<p></p>
<p>The magnitude of the cross product between two vectors is given by <m>|\vec{A} \times \vec{B}| = AB \sin\theta</m>, 
where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the vectors when placed tail-to-tail.  
The direction is always perpendicular to both <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>, 
and is given by the <xref ref="rep_rhr"/>.</p>

<p>
In the figure, <m> \theta</m> represents the angle between the two vectors when they are placed tail to tail. 
<m>A</m> and <m>B</m> represent the magnitudes of the vectors <m> \vec{A}</m> and <m> \vec{B}</m>.
</p>

</statement>
</definition>

<p>
	The direction of the cross product must be perpendicular to <em>both</em> of the original vectors.  
	However, there are always <alert>two</alert> directions perpendicular to any other pair of vectors!  
	The <alert>Right Hand Rule</alert> is the convention by which you always choose which of these two directions the cross product should point.

			<title>Right Hand Rule</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>The direction of the vector <m>\vec{C}</m> that results from the cross product <m>\vec{C} = \vec{A} \times \vec{B}</m> can be determined using the <term>right hand rule</term>.  To use the right hand rule, place your fingers in the direction of <m>\vec{A}</m>, curl them in the direction of vector <m>\vec{B}</m>, and your thumb will point in the direction of vector <m>\vec{C}</m>.</p>

<note>
	<title>What does the cross product mean?</title>
	<p>
Conceptually, the magnitude of the cross product quantifies how perpendicular two vectors are. 
The magnitude of the cross product is the magnitude of <m>\vec{B}</m> multiplied by the <em>perpendicular</em> projection of 
<m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m>. You can think of a projection as the length of the shadow that 
<m>\vec{A}</m> would cast perpendicular to <m>\vec{B}</m> if you were to shine a light from above.

				<exercise xml:id="x_cross3">
		<statement>
		<p>Label the appropriate angle <m>\theta</m> and estimate its value.  Use your estimate and the value <m>a = 15</m> for the magnitude of both vectors to estimate the magnitude of <m>\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2</m>.</p>
