    <p>
One useful property of vectors is that they can be broken down into components along the axes of a coordinate system using unit vectors. 
    </p>
    
 <p>
Consider a <alert>position</alert> vector <m>\vec{r}</m> shown in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system below.
</p>

    	<caption>A representation of a position vector in an <m>xy</m>-coordinate system showing the positive angle from the <m>x</m>-axis and the components of <m>\vec{r}</m> along the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes .</caption>
    		<image source="vectors/vec_2D_position_vec_w_angle.png" width = "50%" ></image>
    </figure>
    
<p>
You can write <m> \vec{r}</m> in terms of its <em>components</em> in the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-directions using unit vectors.
</p>

<me>
\vec{r} = r_x \hat{x} + r_y\hat{y} 
</me>	

<p>
The scalar quantities <m> r_x</m> and <m> r_y </m> are called the <alert>components</alert> of <m> \vec{r}</m>. When multiplied by the unit vectors <m> \hat{x}</m> and  <m> \hat{y}</m> they form a vector quantity. The scalar quantities <m> r_x</m> and <m> r_y </m> tell us how far we must move in the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-direction to be at position <m> \vec{r}</m>.
</p>

        <description>MIT Magnitude and Direction.</description>
      </video>

<p>
The magnitude, <m>r</m>, of vector <m> \vec{r}</m>  (magnitudes will be written without the vector arrows overhead) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length <m> r_x</m> and <m> r_y </m>.
</p>

<me>
r = \sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2}
</me>	

<p>
Magnitudes are also sometimes written symbolically using bars <m> |\vec{r}|</m> around the vector. Both representations are equivalent.

				<exercise xml:id="x_vector-comps">
		<statement>
		<p>Sketch four different vectors so that each vector points in a different quadrant<fn>the vector shown above is in the first quadrant; the second quadrant has a negative <m>x</m>-component; the third quadrant has both components negative; and the fourth quadrant has negative <m>y</m>-component</fn>.  For each vector, choose an angle and sketch a right triangle whose legs are the components of the vector, like the one in the figure above.</p>
