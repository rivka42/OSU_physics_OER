  <title>Unit Vectors</title>

    <p>
You will often need to orient a vector within a particular coordinate system. A unit vector is a vector that has magnitude of one. 
For this reason, unit vectors are sometimes called direction vectors.

<p>
Symbols like <m>\hat{x}</m> and <m>\hat{y}</m> are special vectors called <em>unit vectors</em> or basis vectors.  A unit vector has the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A unit vector has a magnitude of 1</p></li>
<li><p>A unit vector has no dimensions: the magnitude is 1, not 1 meter or 1 second</p></li>
<li><p>A unit vector always points in the direction along which the given variable is <em>increasing</em>: for example, <m>\hat{x}</m> points in the direction of increasing <m>x</m></p></li>
<li><p>A unit vector is written with a <q>hat</q> symbol instead of an <q>arrow</q> symbol.</p></li>
<li><p>You can turn any vector into a unit vector by dividing it by its own magnitude: for example, <m>\hat{v} = \frac{\vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|}</m></p></li>
</ul>
	
	<p>
	Some authors, textbooks, and resources will use <m>\hat{i}</m> and <m>\hat{j}</m>, respectively, instead of <m>\hat{x}</m> and <m>\hat{y}</m>, but they mean the same thing.

		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				A unit vector has magnitude one, is symbolized with a <q>hat</q>, and points in the direction indicated by its name.  
				For example, the unit vector <m>\hat{x}</m> points in the positive <m>x</m>-direction.
			</p>

 <p>
You represent a unit vector symbolically with a <q>hat</q>. Most commonly, unit vectors are used for indicating the directions of a coordinate system. 
For example <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are unit vectors which point parallel to the positive <m>x</m>-direction, 
positive <m>y</m>-direction and positive <m>z</m>-direction (these are often called basis vectors in a mathematics class).
</p>

<p>
Since <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, their dot products are:
</p>

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{x} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{z} \cdot \hat{z} = 1
</me>	

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{x} \cdot \hat{z} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{z} = 0
</me>		

<note>
	<title>Unit Vector Notation</title>
	<p>
Different textbooks and authors use different notation for the unit vectors.  
Often, you will see unit vectors written using <m> \hat{i} </m>, <m> \hat{j} </m> and <m> \hat{k} </m> to represent the positive 
<m>x</m>-direction, positive <m>y</m>-direction, and positive <m>z</m>-direction, respectively.  
Both notations are equivalent, but many physicists use <m> \hat{x} </m> instead of <m> \hat{i} </m> because it more directly evokes 
the direction in which the unit vector points.
