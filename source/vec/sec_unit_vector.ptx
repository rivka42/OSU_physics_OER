  <title>Unit Vectors</title>

    <p>
You will often need to orient a vector within a particular coordinate system. A unit vector is a vector that has magnitude of one. For this reason, unit vectors are often called direction vectors.

		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				A unit vector has magnitude one, is symbolized with a <q>hat</q>, and points in the direction indicated by its name.  
				For example, the unit vector <m>\hat{x}</m> points in the positive <m>x</m>-direction.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>
    
 <p>
You represent a unit vector symbolically with a <q>hat</q>. Most commonly, unit vectors are used for indicating the directions of a coordinate system. For example <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are unit vectors which point parallel to the positive <m>x</m>-direction, positive <m>y</m>-direction and positive <m>z</m>-direction (these are often called basis vectors in a mathematics class).
</p>

<p>
Since <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, their dot products
</p>

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{x} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{z} \cdot \hat{z} = 1
</me>	

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{x} \cdot \hat{z} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{z} = 0
</me>		

<note>
	<title>Unit Vector Notation</title>
	<p>
Different textbooks and authors use different notation for the unit vectors.  
Often, you will see unit vectors written using <m> \hat{i} </m>, <m> \hat{j} </m> and <m> \hat{k} </m> to represent the positive 
<m>x</m>-direction, positive <m>y</m>-direction, and positive <m>z</m>-direction, respectively.  
Both notations are equivalent, but many physicists use <m> \hat{x} </m> instead of <m> \hat{i} </m> because it more directly evokes 
the direction in which the unit vector points.
