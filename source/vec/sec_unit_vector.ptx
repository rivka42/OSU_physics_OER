  <title>Unit Vectors</title>

    <p>
You will often need to orient a vector within a particular coordinate system. A unit vector is a vector that has magnitude of one. For this reason, unit vectors are often called direction vectors.
    </p>
    
 <p>
You represent a unit vector symbolically with a "hat." Most commonly, unit vectors are used for indicating the directions of a coordinate system. For example <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are unit vectors which point parallel to the positive <m>x</m>-direction, positive <m>y</m>-direction and positive <m>z</m>-direction (these are often called basis vectors in a mathematics class).
</p>

<p>
Since <m> \hat{x} </m>, <m> \hat{y} </m> and <m> \hat{z} </m> are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, their dot products
</p>

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{x} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{z} \cdot \hat{z} = 1
</me>	

<me>
\hat{x} \cdot \hat{y} = \hat{x} \cdot \hat{z} = \hat{y} \cdot \hat{z} = 0
</me>		

<p>
Many textbooks, and authors use different notation for the unit vectors. Often, you will see unit vectors written using <m> \hat{i} </m>, <m> \hat{j} </m> and <m> \hat{k} </m> to represent the positive <m>x</m>-direction, positive <m>y</m>-direction, and positive <m>z</m>-direction. Both notations are equivalent, and are just a convention. Use whatever notation is more comfortable for you.
