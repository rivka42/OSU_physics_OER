  <title>Introduction to Vectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
A mathematical object which has a both a <em>magnitude</em> (length), and a <em>direction</em> is called a <alert>vector</alert>. It is essential that we learn to take into account how both the magnitude and direction of a vector quantity changes when we analyze motion. A quantity that only has a magnitude is called a <alert>scalar</alert>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
In diagrams, vectors are represented by arrows. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector and the arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector. In text, we will use an arrow on top of a symbol to denote a vector quantity. 
     </p>
     <p>
Suppose that we have a vector <m>\vec{A}</m> . The  negative vector <m>-\vec{A}</m>  has the same magnitude as vector <m>\vec{A}</m> , but points in the opposite direction. Once we understand how to visually represent and perform operations on vectors, we will move on to understand how to manipulate them algebraically.

Here is a short video which describes the difference between vectors and scalars.

 <p>
 Suppose that you drive North for 40 miles and then head West for 30 miles. You have now driven a total of 70 miles, yet your total <alert>displacement</alert> is only 50 miles Northwest from where you started. Displacement is a vector quantity. It has a magnitude, 50 miles, and a direction, Northwest.
 </p>
 
  <figure xml:id="vec_displacement">
	<caption>The displacement vector for an object that moves North 40 km and then West 30 km.</caption>
       	<image source="vectors/vec_displacement.png" width = "45%" ></image>
  </figure>

<p>
Another, common example of a vector is <alert>velocity</alert>. Velocity is a quantity that not only contains information about the speed of an object (the magnitude), velocity also gives information about the direction an object is moving. Speed does not have a "directionality" and can be fully described with just a number value. Therefore, speed is a scalar. For example, a speedometer reads a number, 60 km/hr, but gives no information about the direction of motion of the vehicle.
