		<!--
		<solution>
		    <p>One way to subtract two vectors is to place the vectors tail-to-tail and then draw the vector that points from the tip of one vector to the tail of the other.  In this case, the difference in the left case is clearly <em>less than</em> the difference in the right case.</p>

		    <p>You have been asked to walk Dr. Paws around a large park.  Dr. Paws always walks north first, then turns and walks in a different direction for the same distance, and last she turns again and walks in another different direction for the same distance.  At the end of the walk, you find yourself back at the exact position where you started!  Give an explanation for how this is possible.</p>

        <title>The Trees upon the Hillside</title>
		<introduction>
		<p></p>
		
		

		    <p>A surveyor measures a hillside and describes the height of the hill <m>y</m> (in meters) as the following function of distance from the base of the hill <m>x</m> (also measured in meters): <me>y(x) = a_1x^3 - a_2x^5</me> He reports that <m>a_1 = 1.5 \times 10^{-5}</m> and <m>a_2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-10}</m>.  He has also identified three especially large trees (about <m>30 \mathrm{~m}</m> tall) whose bases are located at <m>x_1 = 5 \mathrm{~m}</m>, <m>x_2 = 257 \mathrm{~m}</m>, and <m>x_3 = 300 \mathrm{~m}</m>.</p>

		<statement>
		<p>It looks like the surveyor forgot to report the specific units for the constants <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_2</m>.  Determine appropriate units for these constants.  Describe why these are sensible units given the equation for <m>y(x)</m>.</p>

		<p>You and a friend are each lost in the same forest.  They message you that they are directly northeast of a very large tower that is about <m>3</m> miles away.  You are about <m>2</m> miles away from the same large tower, but you are <m>25^o</m> west of south of it.  About how far are you from your friend?
