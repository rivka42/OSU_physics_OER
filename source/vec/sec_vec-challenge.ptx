		<title>Challenge Activity Philosophy</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
		When you work on a challegne activity, your goal is not just to solve a problem, 
		but to <alert>learn new physics</alert> and <alert>practice communicating</alert>.

	<title>Explanation Task Instructions</title>
	
	<p>Physics is a systematic way of looking at the world that involves building <em>quantitative models</em> and 
	<em>mechanistic explanations</em> for why real-world objects and systems behave the way they do.  
	When you provide an explanation, include the steps detailed below.</p>

			<description>Explanations in Physics.  
			1. Principles - what fundamental physics concepts, laws, or definitions did you start with? 
			2. Claims - clearly state your claims about the situation.  
			3. Reasoning - explain all the reasoning steps to go from your starting point to your conclusion.

	<title>Rectangular Park I</title>
	<p>
	     You manage parks for Corvallis, and you are comparing two rectangular parks that have the same total area.  Park 1 is 2 km long, while park 2 is 3 km long.  Is the width of park 2 greater, less than, or equal to the width of park 1?
	</p>
<p>
     <ol>
		     <li><em>Building Blocks</em>: If <m>l</m> is the length and <m>w</m> is the width of a rectangular park, the area is <m>A_{rectangle} = lw</m>.</li>
		     <li><em>Claims</em>: Since the area of the two parks is constant, we can say that <m>A_1 = A_2</m> or alternatively <m>l_1 w_1 = l_2 w_2</m>.</li>
		     <li><em>Reasoning</em>: Since <m>l_2</m> is greater than <m>l_1</m>, we must have that <m>w_2</m> is smaller than <m>w_1</m> to keep the product of l and w the same for the two parks.  The width of park 2 is less than the width of park 1.  A way of making sense of this is to draw pictures of two example parks that have different widths but the same area.</li>

		     <li><em>Building Blocks</em>: The Building Block for this problem is relatively simple!  Sometimes you will only have one simple Building Block like in this problem, while other times you may have several.</li>
		     <li><em>Claims</em>: An important claim here is that the parks have the same area.  Note that even though this is stated in the problem, make sure you list it here—often there is information in the problem statement that is not directly relevant or necessary to consider.</li>
		     <li><em>Reasoning</em>: Note that you should go through every step of the reasoning here, starting from our Building Block: first, from the claim that two areas are equal, use proportional reasoning to go from the given relationship between <m>l</m>’s to the desired relationship between <m>w</m>’s.  You can mix words, symbols, and even pictures in your reasoning!</li>

		<!--
		<solution>
		    <p>One way to subtract two vectors is to place the vectors tail-to-tail and then draw the vector that points from the tip of one vector to the tail of the other.  In this case, the difference in the left case is clearly <em>less than</em> the difference in the right case.</p>

	<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
	<p>
	     Choose at least one of the Challenge Activities.  Reflect on how this activity was similar to or different from other activities you worked on throughout this chapter (these can be in or out of class activities).  Cite specific activities by name and be specific about how the <em>solutions</em>, not just the activities themselves, were related.  Include a sentence at the end about why you think a reflection activity like this might be useful in helping you learn physics.
