  <title>Chop-Multiply-Add: Non-Constant Acceleration</title>
		
		  
      <video youtube="26vbUjdFpBk"><description>Using integrals in physics.</description></video>
    
	
	<p>A strategy you will use to solve a variety of physics problems can be thought of as a sequence of steps called <term>Chop-Multiply-Add</term>.  You can see these steps outlined in the video above for one example.  Below is another example: if you know an object's acceleration as a function of time and you want to find the change in velocity between some initial and final time.</p>
	
	<p><term>Chop:</term> You can start by chopping up a time interval into small pieces.  Each piece of time is represented by the expression <m>dt</m>, where the <m>d</m> indicates that the actual amount of time is <em>infinitesimally small</em>.</p>
	
	<p><term>Multiply:</term> You want to know about velocity, but you know about acceleration.  Although you want <m>\Delta \vec{v}</m>, the change in velocity over a whole time interval, you can start by trying to find an infinitesimal change in velocity <m>d\vec{v}</m>.  By rewriting the definition of instantaneous acceleration as <m>d \vec{v} = \vec{a}(t) dt</m>, you can see that a way to get <m>d\vec{v}</m> is to <em>multiply</em> <m>\vec{a}(t)</m> and <m>dt</m>.</p>
	
		<p><term>Add:</term> Last, once you have the infinitesimal <m>d\vec{v}</m>, you need to <em>add</em> together every <m>d\vec{v}</m> over the full times of interest, which can be done with an integral: <me>\int_{v_i}^{v_f}d \vec{v} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \vec{a}(t) dt</me>  The left hand side of this equation can be easily evaluated to give <me>\Delta \vec{v} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \vec{a}(t) dt</me></p>

<title>Activities</title>
			<exercise>
			  <p>The following two equations are both reasonable to write down for a displacement vector: </p>
				<p><me>1: \Delta \vec{r} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f}\vec{v}(t)dt</me></p>
				<p><me>2: \Delta \vec{r}= \vec{v}\Delta t</me> </p>
				<p>What is the difference between them?  In what situations would you use the first equation?  In what situations would you use the second equation?</p>

			<title>Super Mario's Acceleration</title>
			
			<p></p>
			
				<p>Super Mario (mass <m>M</m>) is initially located at position xi running to the right with constant speed <m>v_i</m>.
					At <m>t = 0</m>, Mario finds a Super Star that results in the following force acting on him: 
					<me>\vec{F}^* = F_o\left(1 - \frac{t}{T}\right)\hat{x}</me> 
					Find the time and position at which Mario has returned to his initial velocity.</p>
			
			<p><alert>1. Analyze and Represent</alert></p>
			
			<p>
				<alert>Representation:</alert> sketch a graph of the force as a function of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<alert>Quantities:</alert> Give physical interpretations for <m>F_o</m> and <m>T</m>
				</p>
			
			<p><alert>2. Calculate</alert></p>
			
			<p>
				First find a symbolic expression for Mario's velocity as a function of time.  
				Then use your expression to find when Mario's velocity is equal to <m>v_i</m>.  
				Last of all, find Mario's position.
				</p>
		
			<p><alert>3. Sensemake</alert></p>
			
			<p>
				Brainstorm a way to make sense of the equations:
				<me>
					\vec{v}(t) = \left[v_i + \frac{F_o}{M} \left(t - \frac{t^2}{2T}\right)\right] \hat{x}
				</me>
				<me>
					t_f = 2T
				</me>
				<me>
					\vec{x}(t) = \left[x_i + v_i t + \frac{F_o}{M} \left(\frac{t^2}{2} - \frac{t^3}{6T}\right)\right] \hat{x}
				</me>
				<me>
					\vec{x}_f = \left[x_i + 2v_i T + \frac{2}{3} \frac{F_o}{M} T^2\right] \hat{x}
				</me>
