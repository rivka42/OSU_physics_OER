  <title>Sensemaking: Covariational Reasoning</title>
	
    <p>You previously learned how to make sense of both units and numbers in <xref ref="sec_units"/>.  Perhaps the most powerful type of physics sensemaking is <em>symbolic</em>, since so much of physics is concerned with symbolic equations.  The most general way to make sense of a symbolic equation is with covariational reasoning.
    </p>

	<title>Covariational Reasoning</title>
	<statement>
	<p></p>
		<p><term>Covariational Reasoning</term>, or <term>Covariation</term>, involves examining the relationship between two (or more) quantities to see how they are changing together<fn>"co" meaning together and "variation" meaning changing</fn>.  The objective is to state <em>how</em> the quantities are related and <em>why</em> that relationship makes sense.</p>
	</statement>
</heuristic>


<p>When you use covariational reasoning, continue to follow the sensemaking steps from <xref ref="fig_sensemaking"/>.  </p>


	<example>
<title>Covariational Sensemaking: Area of a Circle</title>
<p>Consider the equation for the area of a circle in terms of its radius: <m>A_{circle} = \pi r^2</m>.</p>
<p><alert>Physical Understanding:</alert>  You might start by considering all the various circles you have drawn or seen.  You might even draw a few circles with different radii to see how they behave.  Together, physical reasoning tells you that increasing the radius of a circle will also lead to an increase in the area, since radius and area are both measures of the size of a circle.</p>
<p><alert>Symbolic Equation:</alert> <m>A_{circle}</m> clearly <em>depends on</em> <m>r</m>; in fact, increasing <m>r</m> leads to an <em>increase</em> in <m>A_{circle}</m>.  You can actually say something stronger: the equation is <em>quadratic</em>, so doubling <m>r</m> actually increases <m>A_{circle}</m> by a factor of four!</p>  
<p><alert>Do they agree?</alert> In this instance, the physical reasoning and the equation clearly agree with each other, as both suggest an increase in <m>A_{circle}</m>.  Even the stronger claim agrees, because changing the radius changes the size of the circle both horizontally and vertically, so it should impact the area more strongly than a linear relationship!</p>
</example>

<example>
<title>Covariational Sensemaking: Displacement</title>
		
<p>Consider the equation <m>\Delta x = v\Delta t</m>, rewritten from the definition of average velocity.  This equation relates <m>\Delta x</m> to two other quantities: velocity <m>v</m> and time <m>\Delta t</m>.  We can investigate each relationship with <m>\Delta x</m> separately by holding the other quantity constant.</p>

<p>Physically, velocity is a measure of how fast something is traveling.  In general, a faster object with travel a greater distance in the same amount of time than a slower object: you might think about a race or a car chase.  On the other hand, two objects with the same speed can travel different distances if they travel for different times, and the more time spent traveling, the farther something will travel.  The equation agrees with both because <m>\Delta x</m> is the product of <m>v</m> and <m>\Delta t</m>.  If either <m>v</m> or <m>\Delta t</m> had been <em>divided</em> instead, the relationship would be inverted instead.</p>
