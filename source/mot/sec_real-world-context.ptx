		<title>An Olympic Diver</title>

		<p>
			You are attending the Summer Olympics and have been taking data of the position as a function of time of Olympic High Divers. You have determined the following position function: 
			<me>
				\vec{r}(t) = \left[ -Tgt - \left(T^2 g - Tv_o \right)\left(e^{-\frac{t}{T} - 1} \right) \right]\hat{y}
			</me>
			
		</p>
		<p>
			You know <m>g</m>, the mass of the diver <m>m</m>, the time constant <m>T</m>, and the initial velocity of the diver 
			<m>\vec{v}_o = -v_o\hat{y}</m>.  Your goal is to determine the drag force as a function of time.

			<p>
				An sprinter can be modeled as having a velocity in the <m>x</m>-direction of <m>v_x = c\left(1 - e^{-t/b}\right)</m>.  
				What is the magnitude of the sprinter's maximum acceleration?

        <title>The Rolling Cylinder</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>A large cylinder rolls along flat, level ground. Because of substantial air resistance and varying amounts of friction, its speed decreases in a complicated way. 
				Its speed as a function of time is <m>v = at^2 + bt + c</m>, where 
				<m>a = -2.00 \mathrm{~m/s^3}</m>, <m>b = -2.00 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>, 
				and <m>c =12.0 \mathrm{~m/s}</m>. How far does the cylinder move from <m>t = 0 \mathrm{~s}</m> until it comes to rest?</p>
		</statement>

		<hint>
		    <p>For the physical representation (part 1b), draw and label a graph of velocity vs. time.</p>
				<p>As part of your sensemaking (part 3c), draw and label graphs of position and acceleration vs. time, 
				and discuss how all three of your graphs are related.</p>
