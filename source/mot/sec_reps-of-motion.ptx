  <title>Representations of Motion</title>
	
	<p>You now have two major representations for describing motion: <alert>motion diagrams</alert> (see <xref ref="sec_motion-diagrams"/>) and <alert>motion graphs</alert> (see <xref ref="sec_motion-graphs"/>).  Coordinating these representations with words and equations can give you a powerful understanding of an object's motion.</p>
	

<example>
<title>Constant and Changing Speed</title>	
			<p>The simplest possible motion is motion along a straight-line path with a constant, unvarying speed. Let's imagine a car that is driving to the right at a constant speed. Suppose you take images at a regular time interval, once every second:</p>
		
  <figure xml:id="mot_car-with-constant-v">
		 <caption>A stroboscopic diagram of a car moving at constant speed.</caption>
		<image source="car with constant velocity.png" width = "75%">
			<description>Six pictures of a car arranged horizontally.  A blue arrow above each car points to the right.</description></image>
  </figure>
	
	<p>You can apply the particle model and represent the car as a point object, creating a motion diagram showing the position of the car at each instant of time and the corresponding displacement vectors.</p>

		<image source="motion diagram car constant velocity.png" width = "75%">
			<description>Six horizontally spaced dots, each dot separated by a labeled arrow.</description></image>
  </figure>	
	
	<p>Notice that the displacement vectors are equal in length when the car moves at constant speed.</p>

      It takes 40 s for a tortoise to travel down the slide shown in the figure above.  Its initial speed is 0 and its final speed is 0.2 m/s down the ramp.  Assume the slide is 4 m long and the given angle is equal to <m>22^o</m>.
