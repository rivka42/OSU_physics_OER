  <title>Representations of Motion</title>
	
	<p>You now have two major representations for describing motion: <alert>motion diagrams</alert> (see <xref ref="sec_motion-diagrams"/>) and <alert>motion graphs</alert> (see <xref ref="sec_motion-graphs"/>).  Coordinating these representations with words and equations can give you a powerful understanding of an object's motion.</p>
	

<example>
<title>Constant and Changing Speed</title>	
			<p>The simplest possible motion is motion along a straight-line path with a constant, unvarying speed. Let's imagine a car that is driving to the right at a constant speed. Suppose you take images at a regular time interval, once every second:</p>
		
  <figure xml:id="mot_car-with-constant-v">
		 <caption>A stroboscopic diagram of a car moving at constant speed.</caption>
		<image source="car with constant velocity.png" width = "75%">
			<description>Six pictures of a car arranged horizontally.  A blue arrow above each car points to the right.</description></image>
  </figure>
	
	<p>You can apply the particle model and represent the car as a point object, creating a motion diagram showing the position of the car at each instant of time and the corresponding displacement vectors.</p>

		<image source="motion diagram car constant velocity.png" width = "75%">
			<description>Six horizontally spaced dots, each dot separated by a labeled arrow.</description></image>
  </figure>	
	
	<p>Notice that the displacement vectors are equal in length when the car moves at constant speed.</p>

	<title>The Rolling Ball</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      The strobe diagram above shows a ball moving from left to right.  A total of <m>1 \mathrm{~s}</m> has passed between each successive dot.  The distance between the leftmost and rightmost points is <m>12 \mathrm{~m}</m>.

			<statement>
			  <p>Describe how the velocity of the ball is changing. Explain how you can tell from the strobe diagram.</p>

			<title>Explanation</title>
			<statement>
			  <p>Is the instantaneous speed at the point in the middle <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the average speed?  Explain your reasoning.</p>

	<title>The Thrown Ball</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      You have a tennis ball that you throw directly upward with initial speed <m>v</m>.  The ball rises to height <m>h</m>, then falls back down.  At time <m>t</m>, you catch the ball when it is moving downward with the same speed <m>v</m>.
    </p>
		</introduction>
					<task>
			<title>Practice Creating a Motion Graph</title>
			<p>
			Use the given information to make a graph of the ball's velocity vs. time.  What assumptions did you make about the ball's motion?
			</p>
			</task>
			<task>
			<title>Calculation</title>
			<statement>
			<p>Determine the average velocity of the tennis ball during this time interval.</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
			<p>Recall the steps for performing a calculation from <xref ref="fig_calculation"></xref>.</p>
			</hint>

			<task>
			<title>Sensemaking</title>
			<statement>
			  <p>Average velocity is a vector quantity.  Show that it is a vector with a reasonable direction.</p>
