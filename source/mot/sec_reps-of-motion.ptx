  <title>Representations of Motion</title>
	
	<p>You now have two major representations for describing motion: <alert>motion diagrams</alert> (see <xref ref="sec_motion-diagrams"/>) and <alert>motion graphs</alert> (see <xref ref="sec_motion-graphs"/>).  Coordinating these representations with words and equations can give you a powerful understanding of an object's motion.</p>
	

<example>
<title>Constant and Changing Speed</title>	
			<p>The simplest possible motion is motion along a straight-line path with a constant, unvarying speed. Let's imagine a car that is driving to the right at a constant speed. Suppose you take images at a regular time interval, once every second:</p>
		
  <figure xml:id="mot_car-with-constant-v">
		 <caption>A stroboscopic diagram of a car moving at constant speed.</caption>
		<image source="car with constant velocity.png" width = "75%">
			<description>Six pictures of a car arranged horizontally.  A blue arrow above each car points to the right.</description></image>
  </figure>
	
	<p>You can apply the particle model and represent the car as a point object, creating a motion diagram showing the position of the car at each instant of time and the corresponding displacement vectors.</p>

		<image source="motion diagram car constant velocity.png" width = "75%">
			<description>Six horizontally spaced dots, each dot separated by a labeled arrow.</description></image>
  </figure>	
	
	<p>Notice that the displacement vectors are equal in length when the car moves at constant speed.</p>

				<p>
					The instantaneous velocity vectors (middle, red) can be found by looking at the change in position on either side of each dot.  
					The average velocity vectors (bottom, blue) can be found by looking at the change in <em>velocity</em> at the start and end of each interval. 
					This diagram assumes that the speed at the start and end is zero, and that the acceleration is zero during the middle.

			<task>
			<title>Explanation</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
			  <p>Describe how the velocity of the ball is changing. Explain how you can tell from the strobe diagram.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
				<p>The velocity always points to the right, and the speed is first increasing and then decreasing.  
				This can be seen by using the definition of velocity, which is the change in position divided by the change in time.</p>

			<p>What is the average speed during the motion?</p>

			<solution>

			<title>Explanation</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
			  <p>Is the instantaneous speed at the point in the middle <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the average speed?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
				<p>The instantaneous speed is the magnitude of the change in position divided by the change in time.  
				The change in time is the same for each successive instant in a strobe diagram, so you only have to look at the change in position.  
				Given that the objects are draw farther apart in the middle, the change in position has a bigger magnitude there, and therefore the instantaneous speed is also greater!</p>
