  <p>
	Velocity is the quantity that will tell you both how fast an object is moving and the direction in which it is moving.  Furthermore, velocity is the rate of change at which the <em>position</em> of the object is changing in time.
  </p>
    
	<definition>
	<title>Average Velocity</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>The <term>average velocity</term> of an object is the object's displacement divided by the interval of time required to move through that displacement: <me>\vec{v}_{ave} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

			<note>
<title>Speed vs. Velocity</title>
<p>When speaking to a friend or colleague you may not make a distinction between <em>speed</em> and <em>velocity</em>, but in physics the words are distinct.  
	Where <em>velocity</em> is a vector, indicating both magnitude and direction, the word <em>speed</em> refers only to the magnitude of the velocity.</p>
</note>

<note>
<title>Time</title>
<p>
Time is a quantity you will encounter throughout your study of physics.  
In fact, most of physics is concerned with predicting what will happen to a system at some future time, or looking back to see the status of a system at some previous time.

	<title>Activities</title>
	<!--
	<p>With definitions like the one above, you should aim to understand each mathematical symbol in the symbolic equation, along with how those symbols work together.  You should also know the kind of quantity each symbol represents, and the units associated with that quantity.  The exercises below are intended to help you build this understanding.</p>

			<title>Velocity or Speed</title>
			  <p>In physics we will use both the idea of velocity and the idea of speed. In everyday language, these two words are often used interchangeably, but in physics they have distinct meanings. Write 1-2 sentences aimed at explaining the difference between velocity and speed to a child.</p>

<corollary xml:id="vid-inst-velocity">
	<title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
	
	<statement>
		<p>
			
		</p>

		<video youtube="tzTCOBEkbgA"><description>An example of instantaneous velocity.</description></video>

	</statement>
  </corollary>

<p>Physics distinguishes between <em>average</em> quantities for intervals of definite time, and <em>instantaneous</em> quantities for infinitesimal intervals.  To signal the difference, you will use the symbol <m>d</m> for an infinitesimal quantity instead of the <m>\Delta</m> symbol that you use for a non-infinitesimal change.</p>

	<definition>
	<title>Instantaneous Velocity</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>The <term>instantaneous velocity</term> of an object is found by taking the limit as <m>\Delta t \rightarrow 0</m>, resulting in infinitesimal changes in 
			position and time: <me>\vec{v} = \frac{d \vec{r}}{d t}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>Note that when you make this change in notation, the velocity suddenly becomes a <alert>derivative</alert>!</p>
