	<title>Displacement</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>displacement</term> of an object describes the change in that object's position: <m>\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_i</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>
	
	<p>Suppose an object is initially located at position <m>\vec{r}_0</m> at some initial time <m>t_0</m> and the object is moving through space over an interval of time <m>\Delta t = t_f - t_0</m>. The symbol <m>\Delta</m> (the capital Greek letter "Delta") represents a change in a quantity.  The time interval <m>\Delta t</m> measures the elapsed time as the object moves from an initial position <m>\vec{r}_0</m>  at initial time <m>t_0</m> to a final position <m>\vec{r}_0</m> and some final time <m>t_f</m>. The vector <m>\Delta \vec{r}</m> is called the displacement of the object over the time interval <m>\Delta t</m>.  Here, the subscript 0 refers to some initial time: in some cases, the subscript <m>o</m> ("naught") or <m>i</m> (for "initial") is used instead of 0.</p>

<title>Subscripts</title>
<p>
You have probably noticed that physics notation uses subscripts to mean a lot of different things!  In general, physics symbols try to be descriptive, choosing evocative letters like <m>m</m> for mass and <m>t</m> for time.  Physics symbols also try to be specific (<m>m_1</m> for the mass of object 1, <m>m_2</m> for the mass of object 2, <em>etc.</em>) and detailed (<m>t_i</m> for the initial time and <m>t_f</m> for the final time).  Sometimes, subcripts might even be combined: <m>r_{x3i}</m> for the <m>x</m>-component of object 3's initial position.  As you practice, you will start to get a sense for all the different things you can use a subscript for.

			<title>Practice: Vectors in the Park</title>
			<p>You and your friend are each standing at opposite ends of a 125 m long park.  Your friend, who is initially due south of you, walks 50 m east and stops to wait for you.  Then, you walk in a straight line until you reach your friend.
			<ol marker="a">
			<li>
			  <p>Choose an origin of coordinates for this problem and make a sketch of the context.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Write initial and final position vectors for both you and your friend.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Find the displacement vector for both you and your friend.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Reflect on your choice of origin for this problem.  What impact did your choice have on how you solved it?  Could you have made a different choice?</p>
