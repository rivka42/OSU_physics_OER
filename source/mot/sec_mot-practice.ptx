        <title>Throwing a Ball</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>You have a tennis ball that you throw directly upward with initial speed <m>v</m>.  The ball rises to height <m>h</m>, then falls back down.  At time <m>t</m>, you catch the ball when it is moving downward with the same speed <m>v</m>.</p>
				<p>Determine the average velocity of the tennis ball during this time interval.</p>

		    <p>When making sense of your symbolic answer, a good starting point is to check which variables your answer does and does not depend on.  As part of making sense, always make sure to discuss not just what your answer says, but what the answer should say!</p>
