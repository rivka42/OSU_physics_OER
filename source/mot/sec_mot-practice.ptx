        <title>Ramp Timing</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>You release a ball from rest at the top of a ramp and decide to assume that the ball’s acceleration is constant as it speeds up moving down the ramp.

Using these observations, you determine <m>\Delta v_{AB}</m> (the change in velocity between <m>t_A</m> and <m>t_B</m>) and <m>\Delta v_{BC}</m> (the change in velocity between <m>t_B</m> and <m>t_C</m>).</p>
