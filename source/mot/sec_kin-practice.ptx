        <title>The Race Car</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>A race car can accelerate from rest to incredible speeds.  In one case, a dragster is able to finish the <m>305 \mathrm{~m}</m> run in <m>3.64 \mathrm{~s}</m> (and it continues to accelerate throughout this time)!  What was the magnitude of the average acceleration during this run?  What is the top speed of the dragster?</p>

		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>The maximum acceleration that feels comfortable for passengers in a train is <m>1.2 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>.  Suppose that train's route includes two adjacent stations (stops) that are just <m>800 \mathrm{~m}</m> apart.  What is the fastest speed the train could attain between the stations and still pick up and drop off passengers at both?  What is the shortest time between the stations?</p>

		    <p>A diver bounces straight up from a diving board and (avoiding the diving board on the way down) falls feet first into a pool.  She leaves the board with a velocity of <m>4.00 \mathrm{~m/s}</m>, and her takeoff point is <m>1.80 \mathrm{~m}</m> above the pool. How long are her feet in the air?  What is her speed when her feet hit the water?  What is her highest point above the board?</p>

		    <p>Two rugby players start from rest, <m>46 \mathrm{~m}</m> apart.  Each player runs directly toward the other, both of them accelerating.  Player 1’s acceleration magnitude is <m>0.60 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>.  Player 2’s acceleration magnitude is <m>0.40 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>.  How much time passes before the players collide?  At the instant they collide, how far has player 1 run?  Assuming player 1 is traveling in the positive <m>x</m>-direction, what is the displacement of player 2 in the <m>x</m>-direction?</p>
