		<title>A Dropped Rock</title>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		<p>
			You drop a rock from a bridge that is <m>45 \mathrm{~m}</m> above the water.  
			What assumptions should you make about the motion?  
			What interesting quantities can you ask questions about?
		</p>
		<p>
			Calculate the time for the rock to hit the water and the speed of the rock right before it hits the water.

		<title>A Thrown Rock</title>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		<p>
			You throw a rock across a flat field to your friend.  
			The rock's initial speed is <m>v</m>, thrown at an angle <m>\theta</m> above the horizontal.  
			Your friend catches the rock. 

		</p>
		<p>
			Sketch a diagram of the situation. Find the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>- components of the rock's velocity 
			in terms of <m>v</m> and <m>\theta</m>.  Calculate the distance to your friend.

        <title>Pitching Speed</title>

		    <p>A baseball player wants to determine his pitching speed. 
				You have him stand on a ledge and throw the ball horizontally from an elevation <m>5 \mathrm{~m}</m> 
				above the ground.  The ball hits the ground <m>30 \mathrm{~m}</m> away.  What is his pitching speed?</p>

							you must be throwing it faster.  Sure enough, <m>x_f</m> is in the numerator of our expression, so this agrees with our physical reasoning.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the other hand, a larger value of <m>y_i</m> means that the baseball will fall a greater distance without actually traveling any farther horizontally.  
							This can only be true if the ball is thrown with a smaller initial speed.  The equation has <m>y_i</m> in the denominator, so once again this agrees!

		<p>You are driving a car on a residential street at a speed of about <m>v = 10 \mathrm{~m/s}</m>

		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>You release a ball from rest at the top of a ramp and measure the amount of time for the ball to reach the base of the ramp.  Your friend performs the same experiment (with the same ball) with their ramp, which is the same length as your ramp.  Your friend determines that it took more time for the ball to reach the bottom of their ramp than it did for the ball to reach the bottom of your ramp.  Is the magnitude of the average acceleration of the ball for your friendâ€™s ramp <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the magnitude of the average acceleration of the ball for your ramp?</p>

        <title>Throwing It Back</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>In the previous activity, you considered a ball thrown up to the top of a cliff.  
				Suppose you wanted to throw the ball back from the top of the cliff so that it took the same amount of time 
				to travel to the place where it was originally thrown from.  Is it possible to do this?  
				If so, how?  If not, why not?  (Note: you do not need to find any numbers: let your reasoning do the talking!)</p>
