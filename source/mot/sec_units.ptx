  <title>Sensemaking: Units and Numbers</title>
	
    <p>
     The measurement of any quantity is reported as a number in terms of some standard, physical unit.  
	 For example, you might measure the length of an object in a physics lab to be <m>17.4</m>.  
	 Without a specific unit of measurement, the number itself is almost meaningless.  
	 You might mean the length is <m>17.4 \mathrm{~centimeters}</m>, <m>17.4 \mathrm{~inches}</m>, or <m>17.4 \mathrm{~miles}</m>. 
		</p>

Science uses the SI unit system (le Systéme Internationale d'Unités), commonly referred to as the metric system<fn>the united States has an entire 
	<url href="https://www.nist.gov/" visual="nist.gov">government agency</url> dedicated to upholding standards of measurement</fn>.  
	Within the metric system, all quantities will be given in terms of base units, such as the three below, 
	which are typically written using non-italic letters<fn><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix" visual="wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix">prefixes</url>

<note>
<title>Base units and derived units</title>
<p>
Units for physical quantities can be divided into two categories: base units and derived units. Examples of derived units, which are often given their own name, include force (the newton) and energy (the joule), each of which is a specific combination of the base units of length, time and mass.
</p>

<p>
<term>Time:</term> The SI unit of time is the second.  The abbreviation for the second is lower case s.</p>

<p>
<term>Length:</term> The SI unit of length is the meter.  The abbreviation for the meter is lower case m.</p>

<p>
<term>Mass:</term> The SI unit of mass is the kilogram.  The abbreviation for the kilogram is lower case kg.</p>

<title>Definitions of Units</title>
<p>
<term>Time:</term> Throughout most of history, the standard of time was based on the mean solar day. However, scientists needed a way to make incredibly high precision measurements of time and so physicists began developing a device called an atomic clock. Atomic clocks work on the principle that subatomic particles called electrons will move back and forth between different energy states when exposed to certain frequencies of radiation. The United States' standard atomic clock is said to be so accurate that in 30 million years it would neither gain nor lose a second. One second is defined as the time it takes for 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a radio wave absorbed by the cesium-133 atom.  
</p>
<p>
<term>Length:</term> One meter is the distance light can travel in a vacuum during 1/299,792,458 of a second.
</p>
<p>
<term>Mass:</term> For many years, one kilogram was the mass of a polished platinum-iridium cylinder, the international standard kilogram, which is stored in Paris, France.  Since 2019, the kilogram has been defined even more precisely using the above definitions for length and time along with a fundamental quantum mechanical property of the universe called Planck's constant.

<p>Checking units or numbers are two of the easiest and most powerful ways to <term>make sense</term> of something in physics.  When you make sense of something, your objective is evaluate whether or not what physics says about a context aligns with your physical understanding and reasoning about that context, following the <xref ref="fig_sensemaking"/>.</p>

<heuristic xml:id="sm_units">
	<title>Check Units</title>
	<statement>
	<p></p>
		<p>For any equation, including at any point while you are solving a problem, you can <term>check the units</term> to make sure the units 
			on both sides of an equation are always the same.  Additionally, quantities that are added (or subtracted) must have identical units.</p>
	</statement>
</heuristic>

<!--
<p>
When we speak about the units of a quantity, we are referring to the base units which make it up. Often times it will be our job as scientists to determine a symbolic equation which gives information about a particular physical situation. Unit analysis can be used as a quick tool for checking whether an equation we have derived is correct.
</p>
-->

<example xml:id="ex_how-to-check-units">
  <title>How to Check Units</title>
	<p>
Suppose you have derived the escape speed of a rocket from a planet of mass <m>M</m> and radius <m>R</m> 
(escape speed is the speed at which an object must reach to escape the gravitational pull): <m>v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}</m>.  
As a speed, <m>v_{\text{esc}}</m> should have units like m/s (distance divided by time).
</p>

<p>
Here, <m>G</m> represents the universal gravitational constant with units <m>\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}^2\text{kg}}</m>. 
Since there is an equal sign, this implies that the base units of either side of the equal sign must be the same. 
If they are not, then there must be a mistake in our derivation of the escape speed. 
You can perform a unit analysis to determine if you have the same base units for each side of the equal sign.
</p>

<p>
<m>\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \stackrel{?}{=} \sqrt{\frac{\frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}^2\text{kg}}\text{kg}}{\text{m}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}}=\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \checkmark</m>
</p>

<p>
You can see that the physical quantities under the square root indeed have base units of [L] divided by a time [T] and so our equation holds true.  
Note the sensemaking steps outlined above: start by determining what units you <em>should</em> get, then find the units you <em>actually</em> have, and 
last compare the two to see that they are the same!
</p>

</example>

	<note xml:id="note_dimensions">
<title>Dimensions</title>
<p>
Physics uses the word dimensions to refer to the class of unit for a quantity.  For example, speed can be measured in units of km/hr, m/s, or mi/hr but the base <em>dimensions</em>, represented in square brackets, are always a length [L] divided by a time [T].
</p>
</note>

<heuristic xml:id="sm_numbers">
	<title>Check Numbers</title>
	<statement>
	<p></p>
		<p>For any numerical value (with units), you can check that the number is reasonable by comparing it to other numerical values with the same units.  
			This could involve comparing different values within a given context to each other, comparing with a value familiar from your prior experience, 
			or using a search function to look up a quantity that has a similar value.  
			Additionally, you can check whether the number should be positive or negative (if it is a scalar) or what direction it should point (if it is a vector).</p>
	</statement>
</heuristic>

<example xml:id="ex_how-to-check-numbers">
<title>How to Check Numbers</title>
<p>Consider the example from the start of this section, where you measured the length of an object in a physics lab to be <m>17.4 \mathrm{~cm}</m>.  
	You could compare this number to the length of other objects you might expect to find in a physics lab.  For example, many objects in a physics lab can be held in one hand; 
	you would then want to compare the <m>17.4 \mathrm{~cm}</m> measurement to the size of a human hand to evaluate its reasonableness.  
	The search term <q>human hand size</q> results in a measurement of between <m>6.8</m> and <m>7.6 \mathrm{~in}</m>, which is approximately <m>7 \mathrm{~in}</m> 
	(note: when checking numbers, you do not need to be precise, just approximate).  
	Converting this <m>7 \mathrm{~in}</m> to SI units gives about <m>17.8 \mathrm{~cm}</m>.  This is very close to the object you measured in the lab, 
	so it seems like this measurement was pretty reasonable!  It is also worth noting here that length is usually given as a positive number, which this measurement is.</p>
<p>You might instead ask yourself: what would an <em>unreasonable</em> answer have looked like?  
	Perhaps your measurement had been <m>174 \mathrm{~cm}</m> instead of <m>17.4 \mathrm{~cm}</m>.  
	This is only about ten times bigger, and still seems like a reasonable measurement for a physics lab (something about the height of a person).  
	On the other hand, measuring something like <m>17.4 \mathrm{~km}</m> would be fairly unreasonable for an ordinary physics lab: 100,000 times bigger than a person's hand!</p>

			<title>Practice Identifying an Error with Units</title>

			<p></p>
			  <p>While looking through a mathematics textbook, you come across the following equation for the surface area of a cylinder: <m>A = 2\pi rh^2 + 2\pi r^2</m>.  You suspect this equation must have a mistake in it.  How can you use units to tell what the mistake is?  How could you use units to <em>fix</em> the mistake?</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
				<p>
				When you add two quantities together, they must have the same units!  The numbers <m>2</m> and <m>\pi</m> are unitless, but <m>rh^2</m> has units of cubic meters while <m>r^2</m> only has units of square meters.  Additionally, since area <m>A</m> should have units of square meters, you can tell that the first term is the one that is wrong: you probably need to get rid of either the <m>r</m> or one of the factors of <m>h</m>.
