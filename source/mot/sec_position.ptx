	<title>Position</title>
	<statement>
	<p></p>
		<p>The <term>position</term> of an object, represented with the symbol <m>\vec{r}</m>, describes the location of that object relative to some origin as a vector quantity.</p>
		<p></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>A position vector is always measured relative to some <term>origin</term> (a fixed location in space) and using some set of <term>coordinates</term>.  In general, position is three-dimensional, but many positions can be described using only two dimensions.  Various letters can be used for position, including the generic <m>\vec{r}</m> used above and the generic Cartesian letters <m>\vec{x}</m>, <m>\vec{y}</m>, and <m>\vec{z}</m>.</p>

<p>As with any vector, position can be written either by giving a magnitude and a direction, or by writing it in terms of components using unit vectors: <me>\vec{r}= r_x\hat{x} + r_y \hat{y}</me>  A graphical representation of such a vector is shown below.</p>

	<definition>
<title>Unit Vectors</title>
<p></p>
<p>
Symbols like <m>\hat{x}</m> and <m>\hat{y}</m> are special vectors called <em>unit vectors</em> or basis vectors.  A unit vector has the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A unit vector has a magnitude of 1</p></li>
<li><p>A unit vector has no dimensions: the magnitude is 1, not 1 meter or 1 second</p></li>
<li><p>A unit vector always points in the direction along which the given variable is <em>increasing</em>: for example, <m>\hat{x}</m> points in the direction of increasing <m>x</m></p></li>
<li><p>A unit vector is written with a "hat" symbol instead of an "arrow" symbol.</p></li>
<li><p>You can turn any vector into a unit vector by dividing it by its own magnitude: for example, <m>\hat{v} = \frac{\vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|}</m></p></li>
</ul>
	
	<p>
	Some authors, textbooks, and resources will use <m>\hat{i}</m> and <m>\hat{j}</m>, respectively, instead of <m>\hat{x}</m> and <m>\hat{y}</m>, but they mean the same thing.  You can learn more about unit vectors in <xref ref="sec_unit_vector" />.

	<title>Breaking a Vector into Components</title>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	     One of the most important skills to master in physics is <term>breaking a vector into components</term>.</p>
	<p>Sketch a right triangle, like the one in the figure above, in which the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-components form the legs and the vector itself forms the hypotenuse.  In the equation <m>\vec{r} = r_x \hat{x} + r_y\hat{y}</m>, the scalar values <m>r_x</m> and <m>r_y</m> are called the <alert>components</alert> of <m> \vec{r}</m>.</p>

<!--
<p>	
	When multiplied by the unit vectors <m> \hat{x}</m> and  <m> \hat{y}</m> they form a vector quantity. The scalar quantities <m> r_x</m> and <m> r_y </m> tell us how far we must move in the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-direction to be at position <m> \vec{r}</m>.
	</p>
	-->
	
	<p>
	An equally valuable skill is being able to start from the components of a vector and determine the magnitude and direction.  In the figure above, for example, the magnitude is <m>|\vec{r}| = r = \sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2}</m> and the angle is given by <m>\tan{\theta} = \frac{r_y}{r_x}</m>.
	</p>
	</axiom>
	
		<note>
<title>Coordinates</title>
<p>
You will start by using the Cartesian coordinates that are probably familiar from math: <m>x</m> along the horizontal axis and <m>y</m> along the vertical axis (plus <m>z</m> if you need it!).  Although these coordinates are familiar, they are also arbitrary, and you will soon find that physics likes to use other coordinates when it is convenient for a situation.  This may mean rotating the Cartesian coordinates so they are tilted, using different coordinates for two different objects in the same context, or even using non-Cartesian coordinates such as circular (polar) coordinates.
