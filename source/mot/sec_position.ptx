	<title>Position</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>position</term> of an object describes the location of that object relative to some origin as a vector quantity.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>As described above, a position vector is always measured relative to some <term>origin</term> (a fixed location in space) and using some set of <term>coordinates</term>.  In general, position is three-dimensional, but for now, we will stick to two dimensions.  As with any vector, position can be written either by giving a magnitude and a direction, or by writing it in terms of components: <m>\vec{r}= r_x\hat{x} + r_y \hat{y}</m>.  A graphical representation of such a vector is shown below.  Various letters can be used for position, including the generic <m>\vec{r}</m> used above and the generic Cartesian letters <m>\vec{x}</m>, <m>\vec{y}</m>, and <m>\vec{z}</m>.</p>

<note>
<title>Coordinates</title>
<p>
You will start by using the Cartesian coordinates that are probably familiar from math: <m>x</m> along the horizontal axis and <m>y</m> along the vertical axis (plus <m>z</m> if you need it!).  Although these coordinates are familiar, they are also arbitrary, and you will soon find that physics likes to use other coordinates when it is convenient for a situation.  This may mean rotating the Cartesian coordinates so they are tilted, using different coordinates for two different objects in the same context, or even using non-Cartesian coordinates such as circular (polar) coordinates.

		<title>Practice: Position Components</title>
		<statement>
		<p>As with any other vector, a position vector can be broken into components, as shown in the figure above.  Use what you know about triangles and vector components to write equations relating <m>r_x</m> and <m>r_y</m> to <m>r</m> (the magnitude of the position) and <m>\theta</m>.</p>

		<answer>
		<p>
		<me>r_x = r\cos\theta</me>
		<me>r_y = r\sin\theta</me>

			<title>Practice: State Vectors</title>
			<p>Choose a different state (or country) than Oregon and find a simple map.  Mark a few of the major cities or landmarks on the map (at least three).
			<ol marker="a">
			<li>
			  <p>Choose a coordinate system and an origin and mark them on your map.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Draw position vectors for each of the locations you marked on your map.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Write each position vector in rectangular form like <m>\vec{r} = r_x\hat{x} + r_y\hat{y}</m>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>Look up any appropriate numbers to find a numerical position vector for each point.</p>

			<description>2. Calculating an Unknown Quantity.  2a. Represent principles – identify relevant concepts, laws, or definitions.  2b. Find unknown(s) symbolically – without numbers, find any unknown(s) in terms of symbols representing known quantities.  2c. Plug in numbers – plug numbers (with units) into your symbolic answer! </description></image>
