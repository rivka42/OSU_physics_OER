        <title>Moving Cars</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>At <m>t_1</m>, car A and car B are each located at position <m>x_o</m> moving forward at speed <m>v</m>.  At <m>t_2</m>, car A is located at position <m>2x_o</m> moving forward at speed <m>3v</m>, while car B is located at position <m>2x_o</m> but is moving backward at speed <m>v</m>.</p>
		    <p>Is the average velocity of car A between <m>t_1</m> and <m>t_2</m> <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the average velocity of car B between <m>t_1</m> and <m>t_2</m>?</p>

        <title>Bouncing Bumper Cars</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>Two bumper cars roll toward each other as shown in the figure below.  The left side shows the cars before they bounce and the right side shows the cars after they bounce.  The vector beside each car represents the velocity of the car at that instant.</p>
