        <title>Ramp Timing</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>You release a ball from rest at the top of a ramp and decide to assume that the ball’s acceleration is constant as it speeds up moving down the ramp.  You observe the ball at three times while it is on the ramp: <m>t_A = 1.5  \mathrm{~s}</m>, <m>t_B = 3.0 \mathrm{~s}</m>, and <m>t_C = 4.5 \mathrm{~s}</m>.  Using these observations, you determine <m>\Delta v_{AB}</m> (the change in velocity between <m>t_A</m> and <m>t_B</m>) and <m>\Delta v_{BC}</m> (the change in velocity between <m>t_B</m> and <m>t_C</m>).</p>

		    <p>In a race with a total distance of <m>d = 100 \mathrm{~m}</m>, the winner is timed at <m>t_1 = 11.2 \mathrm{~s}</m>. The second-place finisher’s time is <m>t_2 = 11.6 \mathrm{~s}</m>. How far is the second-place finisher behind when the winner crosses the finish line? Assume the velocity of each runner is constant throughout the race.

        <title>Ramp Experiment</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>You release a ball from rest at the top of a ramp and measure the amount of time for the ball to reach the base of the ramp.  Your friend performs the same experiment (with the same ball) with their ramp, which is the same length as your ramp.  Your friend determines that it took more time for the ball to reach the bottom of their ramp than it did for the ball to reach the bottom of your ramp.</p>
		    <p>Is the magnitude of the average acceleration of the ball for your friend’s ramp <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the magnitude of the average acceleration of the ball for your ramp?</p>
