		    <p>You release a ball from rest at the top of a ramp and decide to assume that the ball’s acceleration is constant as it speeds up moving down the ramp.

	<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
	<p>
	     In physics, you are building models that help describe the real world.  
		 As you learn more, these models will become more and more detailed and complicated, with many different parts, 
		 including a variety of <em>quantities</em>, <em>assumptions</em>, <em>representations</em>, <em>definitions</em>, 
		 <em>principles</em>, <em>key skills</em>, and <em>sensemaking strategies</em>.  
		 
	</p>
	<p>
		 Create a memory aid that summarizes what you have learned so far in one page or less.  
		 Your goal is to create a reference you can use to quickly and easily find the information 
		 (say, during a quiz or exam) to answer the types of activities you have complete so far.  
		 How you structure your model is up to you, but organization is important for quickly retrieving information.

        <title>Ramp Experiment</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>You release a ball from rest at the top of a ramp and measure the amount of time for the ball to reach the base of the ramp.  Your friend performs the same experiment (with the same ball) with their ramp, which is the same length as your ramp.  Your friend determines that it took more time for the ball to reach the bottom of their ramp than it did for the ball to reach the bottom of your ramp.</p>
		    <p>Is the magnitude of the average acceleration of the ball for your friend’s ramp <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the magnitude of the average acceleration of the ball for your ramp?</p>
