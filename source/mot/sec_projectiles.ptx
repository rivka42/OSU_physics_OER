	<title>Three Marbles</title>
	<statement>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		You throw three marbles off a table, each with the same initial speed but a different direction.  
		Before you do any calculations, make the following predictions:  
		<ul>
			<li>
				Which is in the air for the most time?
			</li>
			<li>
				Which travels the most horizontal distance?
			</li>
			<li>
				Which is moving fastest when it hits?
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

 </figure>
<p>
		Start with Marble 2.
		<ol>
			<li>
				If the height of the table is <m>h</m>, how much time does it take for marble 2 to hit the ground?
			</li>
			<li>
				How far has the marble traveled horizontally in that amount of time?
			</li>
			<li>
				What is the marble's speed when it hits the ground?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now try Marble 1.
		<ol>
			<li>
				If the angle is <m>\theta</m>, how long does it take for marble 1 to hit the ground?
			</li>
			<li>
				How far has the marble traveled horizontally in that amount of time?
			</li>
			<li>
				What is the marble's speed when it hits the ground?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Last of all, make sense of the solution!
	</p>

<solution>
	<p>
		<me>
			t = \frac{v}{g}\sin\theta \pm \sqrt{\frac{v^2}{g^2}\sin^2\theta + 2\frac{h}{g}}
		</me>
		<me>
			x = vt\cos\theta
		</me>
		<me>
			v_f = \sqrt{v^2 + 2gh}
		</me>
