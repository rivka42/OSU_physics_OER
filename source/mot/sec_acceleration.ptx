	<p>The term acceleration describes the rate of change of an object's velocity.  Like velocity (the rate of change of an object's position), acceleration can be either average or instantaneous.</p>
	
	<definition>
	<title>Average Acceleration</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>average acceleration</term> of an object is the object's change in velocity divided by the interval of time required to change the velocity: <me>\vec{a}_{ave} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	<definition>
	<title>Instantaneous Acceleration</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>instantaneous acceleration</term> of an object is given by <me>\vec{a} = \frac{d \vec{v}}{d t}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

						<title>Explanation: Direction</title>
			<statement>
			  <p>How does the direction of the average acceleration vector compare to the direction of the change in velocity vector?</p>
				</statement>
				<hint>
				<p>Does your acceleration have to point in the same direction as your velocity?</p>
				</hint>
				<answer>
				<p>The average acceleration vector points in the same direction as the <emph>change</emph> in velocity!</p>
