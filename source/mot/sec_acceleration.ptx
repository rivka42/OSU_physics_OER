	<p>The term acceleration describes the rate of change of an object's velocity.  
		Like velocity (the rate of change of an object's position), acceleration can be either average (involving large changes written using <m>\Delta</m>) or instantaneous 
		(involving small, infinitesimal changes written using <m>d</m>).</p>

		<p>The <term>average acceleration</term> of an object is the object's change in velocity divided by the interval of time required to change the velocity: <me>\vec{a}_{ave} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}</me></p>

	<statement>

		<p>The <term>instantaneous acceleration</term> of an object is found by taking the limit as <m>\Delta t \Rightarrow 0</m>, resulting in infinitesimal changes in 
			velocity and time: <me>\vec{a} = \frac{d \vec{v}}{d t}</me></p>

<p>
	Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the <em>change</em> in velocity <m>\Delta v</m>. 
	Since velocity is a vector, it can change in magnitude or direction (or both). 
	Acceleration, therefore, results when there is a change in either speed or the direction of motion (or both).
</p>

<note>
	<title>Deceleration</title>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of motion. 
		When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. 
		Although this is referred to as deceleration in everyday language, the term deceleration can cause confusion, so physics does not use it. 
		Instead, acceleration is a vector, so it is best characterized with a direction, most often with an appropriate sign in your chosen coordinate system. 
		For example, in the case of the train in the figure below, which is slowing down, you might choose the velocity to be in the positive direction and the 
		acceleration to be in the negative direction.  In this case, you would say the train is undergoing negative acceleration, <alert>not</alert> deceleration.  
		Alternatively, you might decide the velocity is in the negative direction and the acceleration is in the positive direction, which would still correspond to the 
		train <em>slowing down</em>.
