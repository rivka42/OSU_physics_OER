		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>In the two situations depicted below, an angled block is at rest on a ramp.  In each case, a hand pushes on the block with constant force.  In Case A, the hand pushes on the upper horizontal surface of the block.  In Case B, the hand pushes on the upper angled surface with a constant force of the same magnitude.  In both cases, the block remains at rest on the ramp.</p>

        <title>Metacognition: Finding Similarities</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>
				If you have not done so already, complete the following two A*R*C*S activities: 
				<xref ref="class_brick-rail"/> and <xref ref="arcs_block-ice"/>.
			</p>
				
		
			
			<p>
				In 2-3 written paragraphs, discuss the similarities and differences between these two activities.  
				Consider both the physical contexts and the overarching strategies you used to approach each context.

	<p>For each A*R*C*S activity, you are expected to complete <alert>all</alert> of the steps in <xref ref="fig_realworld"/>.  
	For your first several A*R*C*S activities, the tips include several helper pointers.

        <title>The Coach vs. the Student-Athletes</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>
				The figure below shows a top-down view of a tug-of-war between a coach (in red on the left) and two teams of <q>student-athletes</q>.  
				The coach can pull with a force of 1500 N, and the two teams together are just able to keep the rock connected to the ropes 
				from beginning to accelerate.  Determine the magnitude of the tension force provided by each of the two teams.

		    <p><alert>Calculate:</alert> Remember that your answer and work should be primarily symbolic.  Choosing good symbols for both known and unknown quantities (including the angles!) can help support both your algebra and your sensemaking.</p>

		    <p><alert>Sensemake:</alert> As part of your symbolic sensemaking (part 3c), try covariational reasoning for at least one of the three known quantities.</p>
