		    <p>In the two situations depicted below, an angled block is at rest on a ramp.  In each case, a hand pushes on the block with constant force.  In Case A, the hand pushes on the upper horizontal surface of the block.  In Case B, the hand pushes on the upper angled surface with a constant force of the same magnitude.  In both cases, the block remains at rest on the ramp.</p>

        <title>The Block upon the Ice</title>
		
		<p></p>
		
		    <p>You are pulling a small, heavy block of mass <m>40 \mathrm{~kg}</m> across an icy lake.  
You pull on the rope at the angle shown in such a way that the normal force on the block by the ice is zero. 
Find the magnitude of the tension and the magnitude of the acceleration.  
Assume the gravitational force on the block points downward with a magnitude equal to <m>mg</m>, where <m>m</m> is the block's mass and <m>g = 10 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>.</p>
