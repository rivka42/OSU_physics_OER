        <title>The Angled Block</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>In the two situations depicted below, an angled block is at rest on a ramp.  In each case, a hand pushes on the block with constant force.  In Case A, the hand pushes on the upper horizontal surface of the block.  In Case B, the hand pushes on the upper angled surface with a constant force of the same magnitude.  In both cases, the block remains at rest on the ramp.</p>

		    <p>A gymnast is training by hanging from two ropes attached to the ceiling, as shown in the figure. The angles <m>\theta</m> and <m>\alpha</m> are different.  The gravitational force on the gymnast is 750 N downward.  Determine the magnitude of the tension in each rope.</p>
