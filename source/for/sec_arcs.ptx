<p>At this point, you have learned a wide range of skills that you can apply to a physics context, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Identifying assumptions, as shown in the <xref ref="fig_assumptions"/></p></li>
<li><p>Drawing graphs and other representations, such as a <xref ref="rep_motion-graphs"/></p></li>
<li><p>Calculating an unknown quantity, as shown in the <xref ref="fig_calculation"/></p></li>
<li><p>Checking units to make sense of an answer, as described in <xref ref="sm_units"/></p></li>
<li><p>Making sense of a symbolic equation using covariation, as described in <xref ref="sm_covariation"/></p></li>
</ul>

<p>While each of these skills is useful on its own, they are most powerful when used <em>together</em> to help you examine complicated contexts that often draw on real-world experiences.  Activities where you should carry out all of the steps above are labeled A*R*C*S: Analyze-Represent-Calculate-Sensemake.  The figure below shows all the individual steps to help you keep track of them.</p>

	<title>A*R*C*S Example: Rectangular Park II</title>
	<p>
	     You manage parks for Corvallis, and you are responsible for putting up fences around two new parks that have the same area.  
		 Park 1 is a square, while park 2 is a rectangle whose length is <m>110 \mathrm{~m}</m>.  
		 If park 2 requires twice as much fencing as park 1, what is the area of each park?

						<alert>List quantities.</alert>  The only known here is <m>l = 110 \mathrm{~m}</m>, the length of the rectangular park.  
						There are many unknowns: <m>s</m> (the side length of the square park), <m>w</m> (the width of the rectangle),

		<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						<alert>Represent principles symbolically.</alert> 
						The area of a square is <m>A_{square} = s^2</m> and the perimeter (the length of the fence) is <m>P_{square} = 4s</m>.  
						The area of a rectangle is <m>A_{rectangle} = lw</m> and the perimeter (the length of the fence) is <m>P_{rectangle} = 2l + 2w</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<alert>Solve unknown(s) symbolically.</alert>  
						Start by setting the two areas equal and relating the perimeters 
						<me>A_{square} = A_{rectangle}</me>
						<me>s^2 = lw</me>
						<me>P_{rectangle} = 2P_{square}</me>
						<me>2l + 2w = 8s</me>
						Combine these expressions algebraically by solving the first equation for <m>w</m> 
						and plugging it into the second equation:
						<me>w = s^2/l</me>
						<me>2l + 2s^2/l = 8s</me>
						<me>s^2 - 4sl + l^2 = 0</me>		
						Use the quadratic formula to solve this last equation for <m>s</m>, then square <m>s</m> 
						to get the area of the square!
						<me>s = \frac{4l \pm \sqrt{16l^2 - 4l^2}}{2} = \left(2 \pm \sqrt{3}\right)l</me>
						<me>A = s^2 = \left(7 \pm 4\sqrt{3}\right)l^2</me>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<alert>Plug in numerical values.</alert>
						The two possible approximate values for <m>A</m> are <m>13.9l^2 \approx 168190 \mathrm{~m^2}</m> 
						or <m>0.07l^2 \approx 847 \mathrm{~m^2}</m>.

		<p><alert>3. Sensemake</alert></p>
		
		<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						<alert>Are the units correct?</alert>  
						The units for area should be <m>\mathrm{m^2}</m>.  
						Each factor of <m>l</m> in our answer has units of <m>\mathrm{m}</m>, so squaring it gives <m>\mathrm{m^2}</m>, which is what we expect!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<alert>Is your numerical answer reasonable?</alert>  
						Something a little weird happened.  You got <em>two</em>> numbers.  What does that mean?  
						In this case you were told that the length of the park was <m>l</m>, 
						but you were not told whether the length was bigger or smaller than the width!  
						The two cases correspond to those two possibilities.  
						The units <m>\mathrm{m^2}</m> are not great for making sense of something as big as a park, 
						so you can look up how many <m>\mathrm{m^2}</m> are in an acre (4047), 
						which is a more reasonable measure of land area for a park.  
						This gives us 41.6 acres (this would be a pretty big park!) and 0.2 acres (on the other hand, very small).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
							<alert>Does your symbolic answer make physical sense?</alert>  
							A quick way to check if our answer makes sense is to evaluate how it depends on the given quantities.  
							In our case, the area varies like <m>l^2</m>.  
							First of all, it depends on the square of <m>l</m>, 
							which is something you have seen before in many other expressions for area, 
							such as for squares, circles, polygons, etc.  
							More specifically, this means that increasing <m>l</m> (making the given parameter bigger) 
							corresponds to an increase in the area.  Lastly, we can check special values of <m>l</m> 
							and see what your answer is.  The most special value of <m>l</m> is <m>l = 0</m>, 
							which corresponds to no park at all!  
							In this case, the area of the park should of course be 0, 
							which is what your symbolic answer says as well: <me>A = s^2 = \left(7 \pm 4\sqrt{3}\right) 0^2 = 0 </me>

<p>
A Real-world Context is a situation or problem with a real setting, where you attempt to answer specific questions about a situation that could occur in the real world by making assumptions and simplifications, applying relevant aspects of your physics knowledge to determine both symbolic and numerical answers, and lastly making sense of those answers to reevaluate your understanding of the situation.  Real-world Contexts are what you will spend the vast majority of your time in physics considering.  The figure below shows all the steps involved in approaching a Real-world Context.  It seems like a lot of steps, but remember that you have already practiced each step many times already.</p>
