	<title>Static Friction</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		<p>The maximum magnitude of any <term>static friction</term> force is related to the corresponding normal force<me>|\vec{F}^{sf}_{12}| \leq \mu_s |\vec{F}^{N}_{12}|</me>  The static friction will act in a direction that opposes the attempted relative motion of the objects involved.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>The model for static friction only tells you the <em>maximum</em> value; the magnitude can take on any value up to this maximum, depending on the other forces acting on the involved objects.  The constant <m>\mu_s</m> is called the coefficient of static friction; it is a property of the surfaces involved in the force.</p>
