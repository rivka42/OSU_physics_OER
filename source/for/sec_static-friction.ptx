	<title>Static Friction</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The maximum magnitude of any <term>static friction</term> force is related to the corresponding normal force<me>|\vec{F}^{sf}_{12}| \leq \mu_s |\vec{F}^{N}_{12}|</me>  The static friction will act in a direction that opposes the attempted relative motion of the objects involved.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>The model for static friction only tells you the <em>maximum</em> value; the magnitude can take on any value up to this maximum, depending on the other forces acting on the involved objects.  The constant <m>\mu_s</m> is called the coefficient of static friction; it is a property of the surfaces involved in the force.</p>

			<title>Largest and Smallest</title>
			  <p>A small car might have a mass of around 1000 kg, and the coefficient of static friction between the tires and the road is about 0.9. What is the largest possible force that static friction can exert on this car? (in N)</p>
