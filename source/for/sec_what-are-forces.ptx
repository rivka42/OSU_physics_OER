  <title>What are Forces?</title>

<exercises>
		<title>Introductory Activity</title>
		</exercises>
		<p>Start by writing a short (2-3 sentence) description of how you use the term <em>force</em> in your everyday life. You might want to include an example.</p>

	<title>Force</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>A <term>force</term> is an interaction between two objects (or systems) that causes those objects to experience a push or pull.  Every force is a vector (with magnitude and direction) that has a <em>type</em> and involves two distinct objects acting on each other.</p>

	<title>Forces and Newton</title>
    <p>
      Isaac Newton encapsulated forces theoretically in terms of three laws, known as Newton's laws.

	<title>Activities: Explore forces</title>
				<p>Use the video below to answer the exploration questions.</p>
				<figure xml:id="for_ball">
					<caption>Dr. Paws gets a ball.</caption>

			<exercise xml:id="x_intro-forces">
			  <p>Identify and describe the different types of forces you believe are acting on Dr. Paws in the video above as she chases the ball.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Write a short (2-3 sentence) description of how we use the term force in <em>physics</em>. Highlight any differences between your physics description and your personal description from the first exercise.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<p>Brainstorm a list of possible different types of forces you can imagine acting on something.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<p>The SI unit for a force is the newton (N), while the Imperial unit for force is the <term>pound</term> (lb).  Use a search to find the number of newtons in one pound.  If an amateur soccer player is able to kick a soccer ball with a force of around 500-700 pounds, how many newtons are they able to exert?</p>
