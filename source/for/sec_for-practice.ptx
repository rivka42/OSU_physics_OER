		<title>Elevator</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The force of gravity on an 80-kg person is about <m>800 \mathrm{~N}</m>. Suppose this person is standing on a scale in an elevator that is moving upwards but slowing down with an acceleration magnitude of <m>1 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>. What value does the scale read?</p>

		<title>Pulling on a rope</title>
		<statement>
			<p>An 80-kg person stands at rest on a scale while pulling vertically downward on a rope that is hanging at rest directly above them. Use <m>g = 9.80 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>. With what force magnitude must the rope's tension be pulling on the person so that the scale reads <m>500 \mathrm{~N}</m>? With what force magnitude must the rope's tension be pulling on the person so that the scale reads 25% of the person's weight? What is the critical magnitude of tension in the rope so that the person just begins to lift off the scale?</p>

		<title>Dropping a ball</title>
		<statement>
			<p>On a windy day, a 1.50-kg ball is dropped from rest from a height of 19.6 meters above the Earth's surface. A steady wind pushes on the falling ball with a constant, horizontal force of 8.40 N, to the right. What is the total displacement of the ball from its initial location to its point of impact on the ground? Use a standard coordinate system with the origin located at the ball's initial location.  Also, use <m>g = 9.80 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>. Assume no air effects other than the steady wind.</p>

		<title>Direction of friction</title>
		<statement>
			<p>In which of the following situations is the friction force that is acting on the object not in the opposite direction of the object's velocity? Choose all that apply.</p>
			<p>
				<ol marker="A">
				  <li>A block slides to rest on a stationary table.</li>
				  <li>A block, initially at rest in the bed of a stationary pick-up truck, begins to slide to the back of the truck as the truck accelerates and moves forwards.</li>
				  <li>A block initially at rest in the bed of a stationary pick-up truck does not slide but begins to move forwards with the truck as the truck accelerates and moves forwards.</li>
				  <li>A car initially at rest does a burnout. (It begins to accelerate and move forward as the wheels spin on the ground.)</li>

		<title>Pushing on a block</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A <m>1.40 \mathrm{~kg}</m> block is at rest on a level table.  The coefficient of static friction between the table and the block is 0.40, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two is 0.10.  A person then applies a 6.00 N force at an angle of 30.0<m>\deg</m> downward relative to the positive-x direction. Use <m>g = 9.80 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m> and a standard coordinate system. What is the magnitude of the friction force acting between the block and table? What is the acceleration of the block? What is the acceleration of the block if the person applies the <m>6.00 \mathrm{~N}</m> force at an angle of 30.0<m>\deg</m> upward relative to the positive-x direction?</p>

		<title>Angled ramp with a pulley</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A box (<m>m_1 = 10.5 \mathrm{~kg}</m>) is on an inclined plane with negligible friction between the box and the incline.  This box is attached via an ideal string and pulley to the hanging mass (<m>m_1 = 5.5 \mathrm{~kg}</m>), as shown.  The incline make an angle of 20.0Â° with respect to the horizontal.  Use <m>g = 9.80 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>. Rank the magnitude of accelerations for <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m>. Do we necessarily know the direction of acceleration of <m>m_1</m> without doing any calculations? Find the magnitude of acceleration for <m>m_1</m>. What direction is the acceleration of <m>m_1</m>? </p>

		<answer>
			<p><m>|\vec{a}_1| = |\vec{a}_2|</m></p>
		</answer>
		<answer>
			<p>No, but we can just guess a direction.  For example, if we assume <m>m_1</m> accelerates up the ramp but our analysis results in a negative acceleration for <m>m_1</m>, that means we picked the wrong direction, but the magnitude of our result is correct. </p>
