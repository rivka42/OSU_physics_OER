        <title>The Pair of Wedges</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
		    <p>The figure shows two wedges with different masses: <m>m_2</m> is on a table and <m>m_1</m> is on <m>m_2</m> (not touching the table).  
				Both the table and the surface between the wedges are frictionless.  
				You push on <m>m_2</m> with an unknown constant force in such a way that the wedges move with the same constant acceleration to the right. 
				Determine the magnitude of the unknown force and the magnitude of the acceleration.

		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				The two wedges are accelerating <em>together</em>.  It can be especially useful to choose a reference frame in which 
				the acceleration points along one of the axis directions.
