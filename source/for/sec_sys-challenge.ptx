        <title>The Pair of Wedges</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
		    <p>The figure shows two wedges with different masses, <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m>, sitting on a table.  
				Both the table and the surface between the wedges are frictionless.  
				You push on one of the masses with an unknown constant force in such a way that the wedges move with the same constant acceleration to the right. 
				Determine the magnitude of the unknown force and the magnitude of the acceleration.

		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				The two wedges are accelerating <em>together</em>.  It can be especially useful to choose a reference frame in which 
				the acceleration points along one of the axis directions.

		    <p>The two boxes below are initially at rest, connected by ropes and sitting on tables. Determine the acceleration of the system, assuming that the boxes begin to slide and that both surfaces have nonzero friction (<m>\mu_k</m>).</p>
