		<statement>
		    <p>The two books from class (shown below) are in an elevator that is moving downward.  As the elevator approaches the ground floor, its speed decreases.  Identify and rank all forces acting on the two books by magnitude, from largest to smallest.</p>

		<title>Moving Blocks</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Shown below are two blocks connected by an ideal string that passes over a massless, frictionless pulley. The mass of the larger block sits on a flat, frictionless table, and has four times the mass of the smaller block, which hangs vertically. Determine the speed of each block when the larger block reaches the edge of the table, a distance of 0.75 m.
