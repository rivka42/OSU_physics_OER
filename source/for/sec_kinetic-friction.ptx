				<definition>
	<title>Kinetic Friction</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The magnitude of any <term>kinetic friction</term> force is related to the corresponding normal force<me>|\vec{F}^{kf}_{12}| = |\mu_k \vec{F}^{N}_{12}|</me>  The kinetic friction will act in a direction that opposes the relative motion of the objects involved.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>The constant <m>\mu_k</m> is called the coefficient of kinetic friction; it is a property of the surfaces of the two objects involved in the force that is usually smaller than the corresponding <m>\mu_s</m>.</p>

			<exercise>
			<title>Explaining Friction</title>
			  <p>Give a one- or two-sentence explanation of the difference between static and kinetic friction, aimed at someone who has never taken a physics course.</p>
			</exercise>
						<exercise>
			<title>Exploring Coefficients of Friction</title>
			  <p>Do a search to find a table of coefficients of friction (both static and kinetic) for different substances.  What is the general range of values that you see?</p>

			<exercise>
			  <p>Describe an observation you were able to make using the simulation, especially if you observed anything that you consider unexpected or surprising.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Design and carry out a (simple) experiment to test something using the simulation. Describe your experiment, your results, and what you feel you learned from carrying out your experiment.</p>
