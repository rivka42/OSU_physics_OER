	<title>The Book against the Wall</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      You push a book against a vertical wall so the book does not move.
    </p>
		</introduction>

	<p> 
		Follow the Forces approach to understand the magnitudes of the forces acting on the book. 
		What happens to each force if you push harder?

	<p>
      Suppose you push a different book horizontally against a vertical wall so that the book slides downward at constant speed.  
	  You know the coefficients of friction are <m>\mu_b</m> (between the book and the wall) and zero (between the book and your hand).  
	  You also know the mass <m>m</m> of the book.  
	Follow the Forces approach above to find the magnitude of the force your hand must exert on the book.

        <title>Suitcase on a Ramp</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>
				A suitcase of mass <m>m</m> is at rest on a ramp that makes an angle <m>\theta</m> with the horizontal. 
				You know the coefficients of friction (<m>\mu_s</m> and <m>\mu_k</m>) between the suitcase and the ramp.  
				Determine the possible angles for which the suitcase remains at rest.
