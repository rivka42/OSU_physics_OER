	<title>The Crate on Top of the Truck</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      A truck is initially moving to the right with speed <m>v_i</m>.

	<p> 
		The driver left a crate on top of the truck. You know the mass of the crate (<m>m_c</m>) and the coefficients of friction (<m>\mu_s</m> and <m>\mu_k</m>).  
		The truck begins speeding up, but the driver wants to prevent the crate from sliding.
	</p>
	<task>
	<p> 
		What force causes the <em>crate</em> to accelerate?
	</p>
	</task>
	<task>
	<p>
		Use <xref ref="force-analysis" text="title"/> to determine how fast the crate can accelerate.
	</p>
	</task>

	<task>
	<p>
      What do you think would happen in the above example if the coefficients of friction were very big?  Very small?
    </p>
	</task>
	<task>
	<p>
		Suppose the driver suddenly has to slam on the brakes, causing the crate to begin sliding.  
		What is the crate's acceleration?  Which things are different compared to the first example?

<activity xml:id="class_book-wall">
	<title>The Book against the Wall</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      You push a book against a vertical wall so the book does not move.
    </p>
		</introduction>
	<task>
	<p> 
		Use <xref ref="force-analysis" text="title"/> to understand the magnitudes of the forces acting on the book. 
		What happens to each force if you push harder?
	</p>
	</task>
	<task>
	<p>
      Suppose you push a different book horizontally against a vertical wall so that the book slides downward at constant speed.  
	  You know the coefficients of friction are <m>\mu_b</m> (between the book and the wall) and zero (between the book and your hand).  
	  You also know the mass <m>m</m> of the book.  
	Use <xref ref="force-analysis" text="title"/> to find the magnitude of the force your hand must exert on the book.

        <title>Suitcase on a Ramp</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		    <p>
				A suitcase of mass <m>m</m> is at rest on a ramp that makes an angle <m>\theta</m> with the horizontal. 
				You know the coefficients of friction (<m>\mu_s</m> and <m>\mu_k</m>) between the suitcase and the ramp.  
				Determine the possible angles for which the suitcase remains at rest.

				Remember to follow the <xref ref="fig_realworld"/>.
