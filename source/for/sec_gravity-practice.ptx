	<title>The Volleyball inside the Elevator</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      You attach a volleyball with mass <m>275 \mathrm{~g}</m> to a string and suspend it from the ceiling of an elevator moving upward at speed <m>1.5 \mathrm{~m/s}</m>. 
	  <ol marker="A">
		<li>
			The elevator is moving at constant speed
		</li>
		<li>
			The elevator is accelerating upwards at a constant rate of <m>2.5 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>
		</li>
		<li>
			The elevator is accelerating downwards at a constant rate of <m>2.5 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>
		</li>

	<p> 
		Use <xref ref="force-analysis" text="title"/> to understand what is happening with the tension in the string in the following three cases above.  As you work on each case, explicitly discuss any assumptions you are making.

	<title>In Space</title>
	
	
	<p>
      The elevator is now located above the surface of the Earth by a distance <m>h</m>.  
	  Use <xref ref="force-analysis" text="title"/> to find the new tension.  Explicitly discuss which steps have changed.  
	  At the end, choose a value for <m>h</m> for something like the space station.
