	<title>Net force</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
	<p>The <term>net force</term> on an object or system is equal to the (vector) sum of all forces acting on it: <me>\vec{F}_{net} = \sum_i \vec{F}_i = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + \vec{F}_3 + \dots</me>.</p>
	<p></p>
		</statement>
	</definition>
	
	<!--An object can have more than one force acting on it. If you add up all of the forces acting on an object, we call this the net force. It can be a tricky business, since the forces can be acting in different directions. An object can have two forces acting on it and still have a net force of zero if the two forces are acting in different directions and have the same magnitude.-->

	<title>The Law of Motion</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
	<p>The net force on an object or system is equivalent to the product of the object's mass and its acceleration: <me>\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}</me>.</p>

				<title>Explanation - Three Cars</title>

			  <p>Consider the following three situations: </p>
				<ol marker="A">
				<li>You are in a car when the speed limit changes from <m>35 \mathrm{~mph}</m> to <m>45 \mathrm{~mph}</m>.</li>
				<li>You are in a car on the freeway driving at a constant speed of <m>70 \mathrm{~mph}</m>.</li>
				<li>You are in a car waiting for a red light to turn green.</li>
