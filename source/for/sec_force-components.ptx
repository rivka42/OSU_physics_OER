  <title>Finding Force Components</title>
	
<p>Forces are one of the most important and universal quantities in physics.  They are also vectors.  Being able to break a vector into components is an essential skill that will be useful throughout your study of physics.</p>

	<title>The Tortoise and the Pebble</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      A tortoise is walking across the desert floor when it encounters a small pebble that it wants to climb over.  It uses one of its front legs to act a normal force with magnitude <m>F^N</m> on the pebble, causing the pebble to act a normal force with magnitude <m>F^N</m> on the tortoise.

			<title>Choosing a Reference Frame</title>
			<p></p>
			<p>
			Two potential reference frames, both stationary with respect to the ground, are shown in the figure.  Before doing any calculations: which reference frame do you think would be easier to use for describing the normal force on the tortoise by the pebble?
			</p>
			</task>
						<task>
			<title>Represent</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
			<p>Sketch a diagram showing the normal force on the tortoise by the pebble in each reference frame.  Make sure to include the components of the force and the given angle <m>\theta</m>.</p>
			</statement>

			<title>Key Skill: Breaking a Vector into Components</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
			  <p>For <alert>both</alert> reference frames, determine the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of the normal force on the tortoise by the pebble.</p>
				</statement>

			<title>Metacognition</title>

			<p>
			Revisit your answer to the first part of the activity.  Which reference frame do you think ended up being easier to describe the normal force?  Why?
