  <title>Changing Systems</title>

<p>In physics, you will often encounter situations where you can choose which <xref ref="def_system" text='title'></xref> 
	you will analyze.  While your choice of system cannot change any physically observable quantity, it can often have a big impact 
	on how your analysis proceeds and what it can reveal about the situation.

			  <p>
					The figure below shows a green mentor perched on the shoulders of his orange trainee.  
					An external Force (not shown) acts on the trainee, causing both him and his mentor to accelerate upwards.

					The figure below shows two children with different masses <m>m_1 \gt m_2</m>, each riding on a snowboard.  
					The children are connected by a rope, and the child in the front is being pulled forward by another rope.  
					The child in the back has a known acceleration <m>a_1</m>.
