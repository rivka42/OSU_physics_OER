		<title>Exploring Spring Forces</title>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Play with this spring simulation: <url href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/masses-and-springs-basics/latest/masses-and-springs-basics_en.html"/>.  Play around with it for at least a few minutes.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>With the simulation from the previous question, investigate how the spring force appears to be related to the displacement of the spring.</p>

	<title>Hooke's Law</title>
	<statement>
		<p>An ideal spring that does not deform when displaced from equilibrium will obey Hooke's Law, with a force that is linearly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium: <m>\vec{F}^{S} = -k(\vec{x} - \vec{x}_{eq})</m>.</p>
