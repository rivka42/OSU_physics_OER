  <title>Spring Forces</title>
	
	<p>
		You have now built quantitative models for the gravitational force and the frictional force.  
		Next you will build a model for the spring force.

			<exercise>
			  <p>Play with <url href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/masses-and-springs-basics/latest/masses-and-springs-basics_en.html" visual="this simulation"/> for at least a few minutes.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>With the simulation from the previous question, investigate how the spring force appears to be related to the displacement of the spring.</p>

	<title>Hooke's Law</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		<p>An ideal spring obeys Hooke's Law, with a force that is linearly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium: <me>\vec{F}^{S} = -k(\vec{x} - \vec{x}_{eq})</me></p>
			<p>
				<alert>Assumption:</alert> An ideal spring is massless and does not deform when displaced from equilibrium.

			<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose you have a spring with a spring constant of <m>k = 40 \mathrm{~N/m}</m>.  
			  How far must you compress this spring for the spring force to reach <m>5 \mathrm{~N}</m>?
				</p>
			</statement>
			  <answer>
				<p>
					<m>0.125 \mathrm{~m}</m>
