			  <p>Block A is accelerated across a frictionless horizontal table by a hanging 10 N weight. An identical block B is accelerated by a constant 10 N tension in a string.  Neglect friction in both cases.  Predict whether the magnitude of the acceleration of block B is greater than, less than, or equal to the magnitude of the acceleration of block A?  Explain your reasoning.</p>

		<title>Angled ramp with a pulley</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A box (<m>m_1 = 10.5 \mathrm{~kg}</m>) is on an inclined plane with negligible friction between the box and the incline.  This box is attached via an ideal string and pulley to the hanging mass (<m>m_1 = 5.5 \mathrm{~kg}</m>), as shown.  The incline make an angle of 20.0Â° with respect to the horizontal.  Use <m>g = 9.80 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>. Rank the magnitude of accelerations for <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m>. Do we necessarily know the direction of acceleration of <m>m_1</m> without doing any calculations? Find the magnitude of acceleration for <m>m_1</m>. What direction is the acceleration of <m>m_1</m>? </p>

			<p><m>|\vec{a}_1| = |\vec{a}_2|</m></p>
		</answer>
		<answer>
			<p>No, but we can just guess a direction.  For example, if we assume <m>m_1</m> accelerates up the ramp but our analysis results in a negative acceleration for <m>m_1</m>, that means we picked the wrong direction, but the magnitude of our result is correct. </p>
