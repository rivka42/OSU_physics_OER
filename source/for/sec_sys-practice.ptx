		<p>The two books below are in an elevator that is moving downward.  
			As the elevator approaches the ground floor, its speed decreases.  
			Identify and rank all forces acting on the two books by magnitude, from largest to smallest.</p>

		<title>Angled ramp with a pulley</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>A box with <m>m_1 = 10.5 \mathrm{~kg}</m> is on an inclined plane with negligible friction 
				between the box and the incline.  
				This box is attached via an ideal string and pulley to a hanging mass with <m>m_1 = 5.5 \mathrm{~kg}</m>, 
				as shown.  The incline make an angle of 20.0° with respect to the horizontal.  
				Use <m>g = 9.80 \mathrm{~m/s^2}</m>. 
				Rank the magnitude of accelerations for <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m>. 
				Do you necessarily know the direction of acceleration of <m>m_1</m> without doing any calculations?

		<answer>
			<p><m>|\vec{a}_1| = |\vec{a}_2|</m></p>
		</answer>
		<answer>
			<p>No, but we can just guess a direction.  For example, if we assume <m>m_1</m> accelerates up the ramp but our analysis results in a negative acceleration for <m>m_1</m>, that means we picked the wrong direction, but the magnitude of our result is correct. </p>
