			<title>Exploring Systems of Equations</title>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			  <p>When using Force Analysis, it is especially common to end up with a <term>system of equations</term>.  
			  Suppose you are in the middle of using Force Analysis and you end up finding a system of two equations 
			  that contain three different unknown quantities.  
			  How do you think you could make further progress on such a calculation?</p>

			<title>The Kite and the Wagon</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			  <p>A child in a wagon is trailing a large kite behind her at a low angle while her father pulls the wagon forward 
			  so it moves at constant speed.  Find the force the father exerts on the wagon.</p>
				</statement>
				<hint>
				<p>Model both the force from the kite and the force from the father as constant.  
				(Don't forget to use the A*R*C*S format!)</p>
