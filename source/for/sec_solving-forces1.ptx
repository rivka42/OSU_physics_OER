  <title>Force Analysis for a Single System</title>

      <video youtube="i6yXnUEO82k"><description>A strategy for using forces to solve physics problems.</description></video>
    

<p>At this point, you have approached several Real-world Contexts using the steps in <xref ref="fig_realworld"></xref>, mostly by analyzing the motion of a system.  Now you need to be able to use the same structure when analyzing the <em>forces</em> acting on a system.  The steps below can be extremely helpful.</p>

<p><alert>Understanding:</alert> Identify a system and draw a Free-body Diagram.</p>

<p><alert>Calculating:</alert> Is the acceleration 0 <m>\text{m/s}^2</m> (static or dynamic equilibrium) or not 0 <m>\text{m/s}^2</m> (dynamics)?  Once you know, use the Law of Motion!</p>

<p><alert>Sensemaking:</alert> All the sensemaking strategies you have will work, but a new strategy called Special-case Analysis (see <xref ref="sec_special-cases"/>) can be especially useful.</p>

	<title>Solving for a Different Quantity</title>
	<p>Using the context given in the video above, find the magnitude of the normal force acting on the skateboarder.</p>

			<title>Exploring Systems of Equations</title>
			  <p>It is very common in physics (and especially when using Force Analysis) to end up with a <term>system of equations</term>.  Suppose you are in the middle of using Force Analysis and you end up finding a system of two equations that contain three different unknown quantities.  How do you think you could make further progress on such a problem?</p>

			<title>Practice with Force Analysis</title>
			<statement>
			  <p>A child in a wagon is trailing a large kite behind her at a low angle while her father pulls the wagon forward so it moves at constant speed.  Find the force the father exerts on the wagon.</p>
				</statement>
				<hint>
				<p>Model both the force from the kite and the force from the father as constant.  (Don't forget to use the Real-world Context format along with the steps above!)</p>
