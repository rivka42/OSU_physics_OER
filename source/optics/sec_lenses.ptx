    <p>In this section, we will use what we know about ray diagrams and refraction to understand how lenses work.</p>

        <title>Thin-Lens Equation</title>
        <p>
            The <term>Thin-Lens Equation</term> is defined as <m>\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f}</m>, where <m>s</m> is the object distance to the lens, <m>s'</m> is the image distance to the lens, and <m>f</m> is the focal length. The image distance is positive for real images and negative for virtual images.

        <title>Lens Maker's Equation</title>
        <p>
            The <term>Lens Maker's Equation</term> is defined as <m>\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)</m>, where <m>R</m> is the radius of curvature for the first and second surfaces of the lens, and n is the index of refraction of the lens.
