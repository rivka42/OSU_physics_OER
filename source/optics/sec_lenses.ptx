        <title>Thin-Lens Approximation</title>
        <p>
            In most cases, we will assume that the thickness of the lens is much smaller than the radii of curvature of the sides of the lens. This simplifies our ray diagrams and calculations because it allows us to treat the light ray as bending within the optical plane of the lens.
        </p>
    </assumption>

        <title>Thin-Lens Equation</title>
        <p>
            The <term>Thin-Lens Equation</term> is defined as <m>\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f}</m>, where <m>d_o</m> is the object distance to the lens, <m>d_i</m> is the image distance to the lens, and <m>f</m> is the focal length. The image distance is positive for real images and negative for virtual images. This equation is only valid when using the Thin-Lens Approximation.
        </p>

        <title>Magnification</title>
        <p>
            <term>Magnification</term> is defined to be the height ratio between the height of an image to the height of an object: <me>m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} </me>.
        </p>
    </definition>

    <p>The Thin-Lens Approximation will be extremely useful to us as we move forward with learning about different types of lenses.</p>

        <title>Derive the Thin-Lens Approximation Equation</title>
        <p>We saw in the previous video the equation for a thin-lens (<xref ref="def_thin-lens"></xref>). Derive this equation. It will be helpful to start with a ray diagram of an object in front of a lens producing an image. There are a couple different ways to derive this, so be creative!</p>

    <video youtube="PABQvartcmY"><description>How to draw rays through a converging lens.</description></video>
    <p><term>Converging lenses</term> are where both sides of the lens are curved outward. When light passes through the lens, all parallel rays converge to the focal point of the lens. If the object is located past the focal length of the lens, as light enters the lens from one side, the light is bent, or converges, to a single point on the opposite side, producing a real image. If the object is located within the focal length of the lens, the image produced is virtual.

Two rays extend from the tip of the arrow: one parallel to the optical axis is bent at the lens plane and travels through the focal point on the right side, and the other travels straight through the center of the lens and does not bend. Another red arrow sits on the right of the lens, with the head of the arrow pointing to the intersection point of the two rays. This arrow has a height h sub i and sits at a distance d sub i away from the lens.</description></image>

    <video youtube="HeMTeL_KgKQ"><description>How to draw rays through a diverging lens.</description></video>
    <p><term>Diverging lenses</term> are just the opposite: they will diverge light rays away from each other after they exit the lens. These lenses have two curved surfaces inwards. These types of lenses always produce a virtual image located within the virtual focal length of the lens.

                    <image source="optics/lens_summary.jpg"><description>Three lens diagrams sit side by side. Each diagram has a red object arrow and a green image arrow, and two rays that travel from the object arrow, and through the lens. The intersection point of these arrows is where the green image arrow sits. The first is a converging lens diagram with the red arrow sitting on the left side of the lens and a green arrow sitting on the right side of the lens, upside down. The second diagram is a converging lens diagram with the red arrow sitting on the left side of the lens inside the focal length, and the green arrow sitting on the left side of the lens outside of the focal length. The third diagram is a diverging lens diagram with the red arrow sitting on the left side of the lens outside of the focal length, and the green arrow sitting on the left side of the lens inside the focal length.</description></image>
