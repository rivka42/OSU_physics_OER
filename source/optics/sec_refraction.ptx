    <p>Why does a straw in a glass of water look bent? Why do people look shorter in swimming pools? Why do mirages happen? The answer to all of these questions is refraction! Light bends when moving from one medium to another.</p>

    <principle>
        <title>The Law of Refraction (Snell's Law)</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Light refracts (bends) when it enters into a different medium: <m>n_1 \mathrm{sin}(\theta_1) = n_2 \mathrm{sin}(\theta_2)</m>.</p>
        </statement>
    </principle>

    <definition>
        <title>Index of Refraction</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The <term>Index of Refraction</term> is defined as <m>n = c/v</m>, a ratio of the speed of light over the velocity of light propagation inside a medium. This number tells us something about how much a light ray will bend within a certain medium.</p>
