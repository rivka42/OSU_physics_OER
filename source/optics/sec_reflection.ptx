    <p>
        When a ray of light encounters an object, the light is usually either absorbed by the object or is reflected by the object.  If it is reflected, it will continue moving in a straight line in a new direction given by the Law of Reflection.  Objects like mirrors typically reflect most of the light that encounters them.

        <statement>
            <p></p>
          <p>For a ray of light incident on a locally flat mirror, the reflected angle <m>\theta_{r}</m> is equal to the incident angle <m>\theta_{i}</m>, both measured from the line normal to the surface: <me>\theta_{r} = \theta_{i}</me>

A ray, labelled "Incident ray", hits the top of the box from the left side at an angle theta sub i and is reflected, labelled "Reflected ray", to the right side at an angle theta sub r. The Law of Reflection, theta sub i equals theta sub r, is annotated on the image.</description></image>

                <title>Practice: Corner Reflector</title>
                <p></p>
                <p>A corner reflector is made up of two mirrors meeting each other at a 90 degree angle. Let a light ray hit one of the mirrors so that the ray is reflected to the other mirror. Draw a ray diagram of this situation. What do you notice about the final reflected ray? What is special about this kind of object?</p>
