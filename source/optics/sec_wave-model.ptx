    <title>A Wave Model for Light</title>
		<introduction>
		<p>In everyday experiences, light often behaves in a way that is consistent with the ray model, which assumes that light travels in straight lines, somewhat like an ordinary particle of matter.  However, in some situations light also exhibits wavelike properties.</p>

      <!--
    <p>The wave-particle duality of light is extremely useful, especially when the wavelength of light is comparable to the size of any mechanism or object the light is interacting with. In these cases, you will use the wave nature of light to explain your observations.</p>

        <title>Wave Model Simulation</title>
        <p>Spend some time playing with the <url href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/wave-interference/latest/wave-interference_all.html" visual="light interference simulation"/>. Click on the <q>Interference</q> tab, and on the right hand side, choose the laser pointer option.  (You will revisit the other tabs in this simulation in future sections.)  Make a list of your observations as you are playing with the simulation, then use your observations to answer the following questions.

        <exercise>
        <p>When you look at the screen, how would you describe the pattern of light and dark spots that you observe?  Why do you think this pattern appears?</p>

        <p>What happens on the screen if you separate the lasers as far as possible?</p>

        <exercise>
        <p>What happens on the screen if you bring the lasers as close together as possible?</p>

        <p>What happens on the screen when you change the frequency?</p>

        <title>Light Can Be Wavelike</title>
        <p>
      <alert>In general, the wave property of light that is most apparent in the world is interference that arises between two (or more) light waves.</alert>  For this interference to occur, the light waves must typically be <term>coherent</term>; that is, they have the same wavelength.
