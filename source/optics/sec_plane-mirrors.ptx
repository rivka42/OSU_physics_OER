    <p>We will use the ray model for light to understand how images are created in plane mirrors.</p>

    <principle>
        <title>Image Distance</title>
        <statement>
          <p>If we define our zero point to be the mirror, the distance of an object to the mirror is equal to the negative of the distance of the image to the mirror: <m>d_o = -d_i</m></p>
        </statement>
    </principle>

    <definition>
        <title>Real Images</title>
        <statement>
            <p>A <term>Real Image</term> is created when light rays travel through the image location. These images will have a positive image distance.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
        <title>Virtual Images</title>
        <statement>
            <p>A <term>Virtual Image</term> is created when light rays do not travel through the image location. These images will have a negative image distance.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

                <title>Mirror Illusion</title>
                
                <p>Watch this video about a supposed "mirror illusion".</p>

                <video youtube="gNgSlGn59xA"><description>Mirror Illusion</description></video>
                <p>Answer the following questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is the illusion here?</li>
                    <li>Draw a ray diagram to explain how you can still see the object in the mirror.</li>
                    <li>How would you explain this to someone that doesn't know anything about the ray model for light and reflections?</li>
                </ol>
