    <p>We can also use the ray model for light to explain images created by convex and concave mirrors.</p>

        <title>Parabolic Mirrors</title>
        <statement>
            <p>When we are talking about curved mirrors, we are assuming that we are looking at the section where it is <term>parabolic</term>. This means that all incoming rays parallel to the principal axis will be reflected to or appear to originate from the focal point.</p>
        </statement>
    </assumption>

    <figure xml:id="concave_mirror">
        <caption>Diagram of a concave mirror. Notice there are three rays which help us figure out where the image is: the first ray comes in parallel to the optical axis, and is reflected through the focal point. The second ray travels through the focal point and is reflected back parallel to the optical axis. The third ray hits the vertex of the mirror at the center, and is reflected back at the same incidence angle. Where the three rays intersect is there the top of the object is located. The image distance is negative for virtual images and positive for real images.</caption>

    <figure xml:id="convex_mirror">
        <caption>Diagram of a convex mirror. An image is produced by extending the reflected rays into the mirror. There are at least two useful rays to draw. The first is parallel to the optical axis, and the reflected ray will extend back through the focal point of the mirror on the opposite side. The second is reflected at the vertex of the mirror, along the optical axis. The reflected ray is reflected at the incidence angle, and when extended backwards, will intersect with the first ray. The intersection point shows where the top of the object is.</caption>

        <title>The Mirror Equation</title>
        <p>
            The <term>Mirror Equation</term> is defined as <m>\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f}</m>, where <m>d_o</m> is the object distance, <m>d_i</m> is the image distance, and <m>f</m> is the focal length of the mirror.

        <title>Focal Length</title>
        <p>
            The <term>Focal Length</term> of a mirror is defined as <m>f = \frac{R}{2}</m>, where <m>R</m> is the radius of curvature of the mirror.

                <title>Curved Mirrors</title>
                <p>Spend some time playing with the following simulation. Make sure to click the "Mirror" option. Select the concave mirror first.

                </p>
                <p>As you are playing with this simulation, walk yourself through the following questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>From the drop down menu, select the "arrow" object. Move the object around. How does the image change as you move the object from the left side of the screen, towards the focal point, and past the focal point?</li>
                    <li>What happens to the image around the focal point? Pick three locations before, near or on, and after the focal point and describe what happens to the image.</li>
                    <li>Switch to the "convex" mirror. What happens to this image as you move the object from the left side of the screen towards the mirror?</li>
                    <li>Is there any way you can make a real image with only a convex mirror?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Answer the following questions using what you know about curved mirrors.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A 20cm tall object is placed at a distance of 200cm in front of a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 150cm. Where is the image located? How does the height of the image change, if at all?</li>
                    <li>An object is placed 40cm in front of a concave mirror and it's virtual image is at a distance of 60cm. What is the radius of curvature for this mirror?</li>
