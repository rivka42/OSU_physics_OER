        <statement>
            <p><term>Constructive Interference</term> occurs when <m>\Delta D = m \lambda</m>. These are points where there is a bright spot present.</p>

        <statement>
            <p><term>Destructive Interference</term> occurs when <m>\Delta D = (m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda</m>. These are points where there is a dark spot present.</p>

        <title>Path Length Difference</title>
        <statement>
            <p>The <term>Path Length Difference</term>, <m>\Delta D</m>, is represented by <m>\Delta D = d \mathrm{sin} \theta</m>. Here, <m>d</m> is the distance between slits, and <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the center line and the path to a spot on the screen.</p>

                <title>Two-Slit Interference Simulation</title>
                <p>Play with the following experiment for a few minutes. Click on the "Slits" simulation. On the right hand side, increase the number of slits to two.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Write down some observations. What happens when you move the slit width to its minimum and maximum values? What happens as you increase the slit separation? What happens when you increase and decrease the frequency?</p>

                <title>Measure the Wavelength</title>
                <p>You are conducting the double slit experiment and you have a light source with an unknown wavelength. Your slits are separated by a distance of <m>d = 0.5</m>mm. You measure the third bright fringe to be at a position of 4.7mm to the right of the center line on the screen. What is the wavelength of light? </p>
