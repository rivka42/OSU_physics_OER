        <title>Human Eye</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>The average human eye is about 2.4 cm in diameter, that is, the lens is 2.4 cm from the retina. Assume you have an average eye, and that an object that is 5.0 cm high is located 25 cm from your eye. What focal length must your lens be to create an image on your retina?</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Sensemaking suggestion: What type of lens is this? How can you tell?

	You likely interact with ray optics frequently in your everyday life.  Choose one experience or observation from your everyday life that your model for ray optics can help describe and give a brief description of it using the rules you built.
