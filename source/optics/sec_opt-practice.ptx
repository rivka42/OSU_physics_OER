		<title>Fun House Mirror</title>
		<statement>
			<p>You go to the hall of mirrors in a funhouse and stand 2.25 m in front of a spherical mirror. The mirror forms an image of you at a point 1.25 m behind the mirror. What is the focal length of the mirror?</p>

		<statement>
		    <p>The average human eye is about 2.4 cm in diameter, that is, the lens is 2.4 cm from the retina. Assume you have an average eye, and that an object that is 5.0 cm high is located 25 cm from your eye. What focal length must your lens be to create an image on your retina?</p>
