    <title>Single-Slit Diffraction</title>
    <p>Single-slit diffraction is an interesting case where we still see this interference of light, even when there is only one single slit.</p>
  
    <video youtube="vRNNsP33yVI"><description>Quantifying the diffraction of light incident on one slit.</description></video>

    <p>By using Huygen's Principle (<xref ref="prin_Huygen"/>), we can effectively look at how two different waves, travelling within the single slit, might interfere with one another. We can find where the dark spots are located by using a similar method as we used for two-slit intereference.</p>

        <title>Single-Slit Diffraction</title>
        <statement>
          <p>The location of dark spots due to light shining through a single slit on a distant screen can be determined by <m>a \sin\theta = p \lambda</m> for <m>p = 1, 2, 3, ...</m>.</p>

        <caption>A representation of single-slit diffraction and the intensity pattern that results on the screen. For a single-slit with width <m>a</m>, dark spots are located at <m>y_p</m> on the screen.</caption>
        <image source="optics/single_slit.jpg" width = "75%"><description>A single-slit sits on the left side of the diagram, a distance L away from a screen. On the screen, an intensity pattern is shown. A dashed line extends from the center of the slit to the screen, indicating the middle of the slit and the screen. A solid line extends from the center of the slit to the screen at an angle theta sub p and hits the screen at a distance y sub p from the center. Another solid line with arrow heads on both side extends from the slit to the screen and is labelled as "L >> a".</description></image>

            <title>Single-Slit Diffraction Simulation</title>
            <p>Play with the <url href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/wave-interference/latest/wave-interference_all.html" visual="light interference simulation"/> for a few minutes. Click on the "Diffraction" tab.</p>
            <p>Write down some observations. Play with different opening shapes. For the square shape, what happens when you change the width? What happens to the image as you change the frequency of the light?</p>

            <title>Width of a Diffraction Pattern</title>
            <p>The width of the central bright maxima in a single-slit diffraction pattern can be measured by looking at the distance to the first dark spot. What happens to the width as the distance between the slit and the screen increases? What happens to the width as the wavelength decreases? What happens as the slit size decreases?</p>
