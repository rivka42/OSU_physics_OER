	<title>Electric Current</title>

	<p>Within a circuit, there are tiny positive charges that are living inside each element.You may have wondered what is actually happening to those charges. Take a moment to think about that and predict what is happening.</p>

	<p>The voltages across different elements of the circuits produce tiny electric fields within the elements that will help move these tiny charges along, producing a current.</p>

		<statement>
			<p><term>Electric Current</term> is the flow of electric charge and has units of Amps (<m>\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{s}</m>). It is defined as the rate of charge flowing past a given point in a circuit every second: <me>I = \frac{dq}{dt}</me></p>

			<p>Recall the circuit (<xref ref="precircuit"/>) from <xref ref="sec_voltage"/>. Do you think that the current passing through element B is greater than, less than, or equal to the current passing through element A? Explain your answer.</p>
