	<p>When the capacitor is charging, the current through the resistor as a function of time is given by <me>I(t) = \frac{V_{bat}}{R}e^{-t/RC}</me></p>
			
		<exercise>
			<p>Given the result above, sketch a graph of the current through the resistor when the capacitor is charging.  Describe how the graph would change if you were to increase the resistance of the circuit. Give a physical explanation for why you observe this change.</p>
