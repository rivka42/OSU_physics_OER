			<title>Bird on a Wire</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					High-voltage overhead electric lines are not covered by insulation, unlike wires that are used in electric circuitry in homes. Explain why a bird that lands on a single high-voltage line does not get electrocuted.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					The bird's feet, touching the high-voltage line, do form a complete circuit through the bird, but essentially no current flows through the bird, because the resistance value of the wire is essentially zero between the points where the bird's feet are touching it; whereas the bird has some non-negligible resistance.
