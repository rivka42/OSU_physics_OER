		<statement>
			<p>A circuit diagram is a simplified representation of a real circuit where each element is given a simple icon connected by straight lines corresponding to ideal wires.  Common circuit elements are shown in the figure below.</p>

		When discussing circuits, we will use the symbols above to represent different circuit elements. As we explore more circuit elements throughout the upcoming chapters, we will add more representations to our circuit diagram list.
