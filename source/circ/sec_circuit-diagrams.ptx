		<exercise>
			  <p>Write down a few things you already know about electric circuits from your previous coursework and/or your everyday experiences.</p>

		<p>The image above shows a <term>complete circuit</term>: a continuous (unbroken) path of conductors that returns to where it starts.</p>
		<p>This circuit has three elements connected by wires (straight lines). Each circuit element is represented with a box and a letter. You do not know what each element is.</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>Imagine that you are a tiny positive charge, initially located at the dot.  You begin moving clockwise through the circuit. As you pass through element A, you measure that electric potential (or voltage) increases by 5 V. As you pass through element B, you measure that the electric potential (or voltage) decreases by 3 V. How do you think the electric potential (or voltage) will change as you pass through element C? Explain your reasoning.</p>
