		<title>Ohm's Law</title>
		<statement>
			<p><term>Ohm's Law</term> relates the voltage across a resistor to the current flowing through that resistor by a quantity known as resistance: <me>V = IR</me></p>

		<title>Linear Resistors</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A <term>linear resistor</term> or Ohmic resistor is one that has a resistance <m>R</m> that is constant (it is the same no matter what current is flowing through it).</p>
