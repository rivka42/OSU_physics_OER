		<title>Ohm's Law</title>
		<statement>
			<p><term>Ohm's Law</term> relates the voltage across a resistor to the current flowing through that resistor by a quantity known as resistance: <me>V = IR</me></p>
		</statement>

		<title>Linear Resistors</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A <term>linear resistor</term> or Ohmic resistor is one that has a resistance <m>R</m> that is constant (it is the same no matter what current is flowing through it).</p>
		</statement>
	</assumption>

	<p>
		Devices or circuit elements that obey a linear relationship between the current and the voltage is considered to be "Ohmic". Ohm's Law is particularly useful to determine relationships between the voltage, current, and resistance of a resistor element. Be very careful when using Ohm's Law for other elements if you do not know if they are Ohmic. A common misconception is that Ohm's Law can be used for lightbulbs. In general, lightbulbs are considered to be non-Ohmic, and therefore may not obey the linear relationship that is Ohm's Law.
