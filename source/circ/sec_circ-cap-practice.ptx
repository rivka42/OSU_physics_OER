					Consider the circuit shown above, which is a variant of the circuit from class. All bulbs are identical, and all batteries are ideal and identical. (Note that the orientation of battery D has changed.)

					<li>
						<p>
							Is bulb 2 brighter than, dimmer than, or as bright as bulb 1? Explain your reasoning

					<li>
						<p>
							Sketch appropriate voltage diagrams for this circuit.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Use your diagrams to rank the voltages <m>V_1</m>, <m>V_2</m>, <m>V_C</m>, and <m>V_D</m> from greatest to least. Explain how you determined your answer.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							On the circuit diagram, draw arrows to indicate the direction of the current through each battery and each bulb.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Rank the currents <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>, <m>I_C</m>, and <m>I_D</m> from greatest to least. Explain how you determined your answer.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Suppose that bulb 1 were removed, leaving a gap in the circuit. Would this cause bulb 2 to get brighter, less bright, or to stay the same brightness? Explain.

						<p>
							Suppose that battery C were removed, leaving a gap in the circuit. Would this cause bulbs 1 and 2 to get brighter, less bright, or to stay the same brightness? Explain.

					The switch shown has been set to the left in the circuit above for a long time (the two batteries are identical). You then flip the switch to the right. Immediately after you flip the switch, what is the current through the circuit?
