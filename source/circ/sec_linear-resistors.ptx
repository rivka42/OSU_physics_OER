		<title>Linear Resistors</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A <term>linear resistor</term> is a resistor which abides Ohm's Law.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>When there is more than one resistor in a circuit, you can find the total resistance using the rules of series and parallel resistors.</p>

		<title>Adding Resistors in Series</title>
		<statement>
			<p>If <m>N</m> resistors are in series, the total resistance is: <me>R_{\mathrm{total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} R_i</me></p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<definition>
		<title>Adding Resistors in Parallel</title>
		<statement>
			<p>If <m>N</m> resistors are in parallel, the total resistance is: <me>\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{total}}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac{1}{R_i}</me></p>
		</statement>
