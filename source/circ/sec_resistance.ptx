			</p>
			<p>Circuit elements present obstacles to the flow of electric current in circuits, which we define as <term>Resistance</term> and we write as <m>R</m>. Resistance is measured in units of Ohms (<m>\Omega</m>).</p>

	<p>
		Resistance in circuits arises in the form of a resistor. Resistors are elements commonly seen in circuits, and can alter how current flows and provide a voltage drop. The energy lost across a resistor is dissipated in the form of heat. Resistors will be discussed in more detail in an upcoming section.
