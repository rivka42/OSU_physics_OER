		<title>Circuit I</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The circuit shown on top in the image above has four identical light bulbs and an ideal battery.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Rank the bulbs according to brightness, from brightest to dimmest.
					</p>
				</li>
				<p>
					A wire isnow added to the circuit, as shown in the bottom diagram.
				</p>
				<li>
					<p>
						Does the brightness of bulb C increase, decrease, or remain the same?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Does the brightness of bulb A increase, decrease, or remain the same?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>

		<title>Circuit II</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The circuit above shows four identical bulbs connected to an ideal battery. The switch is initially closed.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Rank the bulbs according to brightness, in order from brightest to dimmest. If two bulbs have the same brightness, indicate that explicitly.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						When the switch is opened, will bulb A get brighter, get dimmer, or remain the same brightness?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						When the switch is opened, will bulb B get brighter, get dimmer, or remain the same brightness?
					</p>

				The total amount of charge that has entered a wire at time t is given by: <me>

	<investigation>
		<title>Circuit III</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Rank the light bulbs shown above according to brightness. If any bulb does not light, or if you do not have enough information, state so explicitly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, explain your reasoning for how you ranked each of the following pairs of bulbs:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						A &amp; B
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A &amp; C
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A &amp; D
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				You are strongly encouraged to use voltage diagrams to help your reasoning.
