			<p>Which of the following do you think describes the current in the third wire? Explain your reasoning.</p>
			<ol type = "a">
				<li><p><m>I_3 = I_1 + I_2</m></p></li>
				<li><p><m>I_3 = I_1 \times I_2</m></p></li>
				<li><p><m>I_3 = I_1 - I_2</m></p></li>
				<li><p><m>\frac{1}{I_3} = \frac{1}{I_1} + \frac{1}{I_2}</m></p></li>
				<li><p><m>I_3 = </m> the bigger of <m>I_1</m> and <m>I_2</m></p></li>
				<li><p>I can't figure out <m>I_3</m></p></li>

		<title>The Junction Rule</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>Junction Rule</term> tells us that at a junction, the sum of the incoming currents must equal the sum of the outgoing currents: <me>\sum I_{\mathrm{in}} = \sum I_{\mathrm{out}}</me></p>
		</statement>
	</principle>
	
		<p>The Junction Rule is based on conservation of charge.  Along with the Loop Rule, it forms a basis for analyzing all circuits.  Together, the two rules are sometimes known as Kirchhoff's Laws.</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>One of your friends builds a circuit and measures a negative current through one of the light bulbs in their circuit. What do you think the negative means for current?</p>
