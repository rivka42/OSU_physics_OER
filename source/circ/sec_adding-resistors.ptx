	<p>When there is more than one resistor in a circuit, you can find the total resistance using the rules of series and parallel resistors.</p>

	<principle>
		<title>Adding Resistors in Series</title>
		<statement>
			<p>If <m>N</m> resistors are in series, the equivalent resistance is: <me>R_{\mathrm{total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} R_i = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots</me></p>
		</statement>
	</principle>

	<principle>
		<title>Adding Resistors in Parallel</title>
		<statement>
			<p>If <m>N</m> resistors are in parallel, the equivalent resistance is: <me>\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{total}}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac{1}{R_i} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots</me></p>
		</statement>
