	<title>Power in Circuits</title>

	<p>Energy is transferred from chemical potential energy stored within the battery to the charges that move around the circuit. As the charges travel around the circuit, they lose energy through resistors. Since there are a lot of charges moving in a circuit, it's often useful to talk about the power delivered to resistance elements:</p>

			<p>Old incandescent light bulbs are usually rated to provide 60 W of power. When you plug it into the wall (120 V) the light bulb will light up. What do you think is the resistance of the light bulb when it is plugged in (in Ohms)?</p>
