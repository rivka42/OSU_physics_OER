	<p>Voltage diagrams are very useful representations to draw when analyzing circuits. They can be as useful as free-body diagrams!</p>

		<title>Voltage Diagrams</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A voltage diagram shows how the voltage changes throughout a circuit. Typically, a voltage diagram starts at zero and will utilize an arrow to show how the voltage is increasing or decreasing across certain elements. The Loop Rule (<xref ref="loop-rule"/>) is often used in tandem with voltage diagrams.</p>
