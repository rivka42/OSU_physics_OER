	<statement>
	<p>For a system with a small massive object (mass <m>m</m>) and a large massive object (mass <m>M</m>)<fn>the mass of the large object must be distributed spherically</fn>, the <term>gravitational potential energy</term> is <m>U_{grav} = -\frac{GmM}{r}</m>, where <m>r</m> is the distance between the centers of the two objects<fn>here <m>r</m> must be greater than the radius of the large massive object</fn>.</p>

<title>Approximation: Near the Surface of the Earth</title>
<statement>
			  <p>When you are near the surface of the Earth, you can model the gravitational force as <m>\vec{F}^g = mg (-\hat{y})</m>.  Use this to find the change in gravitational potential energy when an object goes from <m>y_i = 0</m> to <m>y_f = h</m>.</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>Use the definition of potential energy as an integral.  Remember to include the minus sign!</p>

	<title>Gravitational Potential Energy near the Surface of the Earth</title>
	<statement>
	<p>For a system with a small massive object (mass <m>m</m>) close to the surface of the Earth, the <term>gravitational potential energy</term> is <m>U_{grav} = mgy</m>, where <m>y</m> is the vertical distance from the location where <m>U = 0</m>.</p>
