  <title>Work</title>
	
	<p>
		The models you built for forces in the previous chapters can be used to explain many different physical systems.  
		For some systems, it is useful to define the <alert>work</alert> done by a force.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def_work">
	<title>Work by a Constant Force</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
			
		</p>
	<p>The <term>work</term> done by a single, constant force <m>\vec{F}</m> on an object moving from 
	<m>\vec{r}_i</m> to <m>\vec{r}_f</m> is: <me>W = \vec{F} \cdot \Delta \vec{r}</me> </p>
	</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Every force that acts on an object has the capacity to do work.  
		Since objects frequently have many forces acting on them, it can be useful to keep track in a table like the one introduced below.
	</p>

	<lemma xml:id="rep_work-table">
		<title>Work Table</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				A <term>Work Table</term> is a representation for keeping track of the work done on a system.  
				In a work table, each row represents a different force acting on the system, while the columns 
				represent the displacement, force, and work for that force.  A work table can be qualitative, 
				where you only represent the direction of the displacement and the force and the sign of the work, 
				or quantitative, where you include the full value for each quantity.

	</lemma>

	<p>
		At the end of a work table, you can often easily add up the last column to get the net work on the system!  
		Sometimes, if you only have a qualitative work table, you may not have enough information to determine the net work.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def_net-work">
		<title>Net (External) Work</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
		<p>The net work on a system is the sum of the works done by every external force acting on the system: <me>
			W_{\text{net,ext}} = \sum_i W_i = W_1 + W_2 + W_3 + \dots
		</me>
		</p>
		</statement>
		</definition>

	<example>
		<title>Work on a Grocery Bag</title>
		<p>
			In the last part of <xref ref="class_groceries"/>, you lifted a bag of groceries so that it moves upward at constant speed.  
			Find the work done on the bag of groceries by each force.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bag is an obvious choice for a system, along with a Cartesian reference frame stationary with respect to the ground.  
			Since the bag is moving upward at constant speed, there are two forces acting on the bag, as shown in the figure below.
		</p>

	<p>
		Below are examples of qualitative and quantitative Work Tables summarizing the work done by each force, 
		and the net work at the end, supposing the mass of the bag is <m>m</m> and the vertical displacement of the bag is <m>h</m>.

		Note that in this example, the displacement is the same for both forces, because the system consists only of a single object.

	<!--ORIGINAL WORK SECTION

    <p>
     As you saw in previous sections, one way to change the energy of an object is to do work on it.  Work arises when a force acts on an object that is displaced.
