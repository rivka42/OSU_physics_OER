	<p>
		The models you built for forces in the previous chapters can be used to explain many different physical systems.  
		For some systems, it is useful to define the <alert>work</alert> done by a force.

				<answer>
				<p>Option 1 is correct because it separately calculates the work by each force before adding them together!</p>

	<!--ORIGINAL WORK SECTION

    <p>
     As you saw in previous sections, one way to change the energy of an object is to do work on it.  Work arises when a force acts on an object that is displaced.

	<title>Activities: Exploring Work</title>

			<exercise>
			  <p>The definition of work can look pretty complicated the first time you see it!  Make a list of all the <em>symbols</em> you see in the equation.  For each symbol, write a short description of what you think that symbol means in the context of this equation.</p>
