        <title>Colliding Astronauts</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>Two astronauts, Michael and Collins, conduct several collision experiments in an environment with no external forces.  Michael has a larger mass than Collins.  In each experiment, Michael is initially moving with speed <m>v_i</m> in the positive <m>x</m>-direction and Collins is initially at rest.</p>

				<li><p>In case C, Michael's final velocity is <m>\frac{v_i}{4}</m> in the positive <m>x</m>-direction.</p></li>

        <title>The Exploding Firecracker</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>You throw a firecracker vertically upward.  At <m>t = 0</m>, the firecracker is moving upward with speed <m>v_1</m>, 
				at which point it begins to explode, splitting into an upper piece with mass <m>m_u</m> and a lower piece with mass <m>m_l</m>.  
				The explosion finishes at <m>t = \frac{v_1}{g}</m>, at which point you observe that the upper piece is still moving upward with speed <m>3v_1</m>.</p>
				<p>Determine the velocity of the lower piece at <m>t = \frac{v_1}{g}</m>.</p>

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<p></p>
    <p>
      In studying energy and momentum, you learned about conservation laws, which provide a different perspective on the world than forces do.  
	  Summarize the conservation laws you learned about, including information about <em>when</em> each quantity is conserved.
