<p>In <xref ref="sec_solving-forces1"></xref>, you saw a strategy for force analysis.  
	Approaching a context from an energy perspective follows a similar structure, but the goals are often different.

	<title>Solve Multiple Ways</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>Many problems in physics can be solved multiple ways.  
			Since both ways should result in the same answer, this can be a strong confirmation that an answer is correct.  
			Often, Force Analysis and Energy Analysis provide two distinct ways of solving a problem.</p>

			<title>A*R*C*S: Pulling a Box</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
			  <p>In <xref ref="x_work-box"></xref>, you considered the situation of pulling a box across a flat, level floor using a rope that makes an angle to the horizontal.  Assuming you know the tension in the rope, find the speed of the box after it has traveled across the room.</p>
				</statement>
				<hint>Try solving this problem with both Energy Analysis and Force Analysis.</hint>
