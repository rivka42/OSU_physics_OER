  <title>Energy Analysis</title>
	
<p>In <xref ref="sec_solving-forces1"></xref>, you saw a strategy for force analysis.  Approaching a context from an energy perspective follows a similar structure, but the goals are often different. The steps below can be extremely helpful.</p>

<p><alert>Understanding:</alert> Identify a system and draw an Energy System Diagram.</p>

<p><alert>Calculating:</alert> Is your system's energy conserved or not?  Once you know, use the Work-energy Theorem!</p>

<p><alert>Sensemaking:</alert> All the sensemaking strategies you have will work, but a new strategy is sometimes useful: Solve Multiple Ways.</p>

				<heuristic xml:id="sense_solve-multiple-ways">
	<title>Solve Multiple Ways</title>
	<statement>
		<p>Many problems in physics can be solved multiple ways.  Since both ways should result in the same answer, this can be a strong confirmation that an answer is correct.  Often, Force Analysis and Energy Analysis provide two distinct ways of solving a problem.</p>

			<title>Real-world Context: Pulling a Box</title>
			<statement>
			  <p>In <xref ref="x_work-box"></xref>, you considered the situation of pulling a box across a flat, level floor using a rope that makes an angle to the horizontal.  Assuming you know the tension in the rope, find the speed of the box after it has traveled across the room.</p>
				</statement>
				<hint>Try solving this problem with both Energy Analysis and Force Analysis.</hint>
