	<definition>
	<title>Impulse</title>
	<statement>
	  <p>An external force <m>\vec{F}</m> acting on a system from <m>t_i</m> to <m>t_f</m> will deliver an impulse to the system of: <m>\vec{J} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \vec{F}dt</m>. </p>
	</statement>

	<title>The Impulse-Momentum Theorem</title>
	<statement>
	  <p>The net impulse delivered to a system is equal to the change in momentum for that system: <m>\vec{J}_{net} = \Delta \vec{p}</m>. </p>
	</statement>
	</principle>

<p>When would it be appropriate to say that the momentum of a system is conserved?  Give an example of a context where you think the momentum of a system is conserved.  Give a different example of a context where you think the momentum of a system is <em>not</em> conserved.  Do you think your answers depend on what systems you choose?</p>
