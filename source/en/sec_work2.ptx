	<title>Work Warmup</title>

	<p>
		You push a heavy box across the ground at constant speed, as shown in the free-body diagram below.  
		Is the work done by each force positive, negative, or zero?

<activity xml:id="class_rev-crate-truck">
	<title>Revisit: The Crate on Top of the Truck</title>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall <xref ref="class_crate-truck"/>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Draw a free-body diagram for the crate.  
		Make a qualitative <xref ref="rep_work-table"/> indicating the direction of each force, the direction of the corresponding displacement, and the sign of the work done by each force

<activity xml:id="class_rev-brick-rail">
	<title>Revisit: The Brick against the Railing</title>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall <xref ref="class_brick-rail"/>.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Assume you pull on the rope with tension <m>T</m> at the angle shown so the acceleration of the brick is to the left, 
		causing the brick to slide a total distance <m>d</m>.
		Draw a free-body diagram for the brick.  
		Make a quantitative <xref ref="rep_work-table"/> indicating the direction of each force, the direction of the corresponding displacement, and the sign of the work done by each force

<activity xml:id="class_book-push">
	<title>Pushing Books</title>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Two books on the same frictionless surface are pushed toward each other; consider the system of both books.  
		Assume each hand pushes with the same constant force <m>F^H</m> and that each book moves the same distance <m>d_b</m>.  
		Draw a free-body diagram for the system.  
		Make a quantitative Work Table indicating the direction of each force, the direction of the corresponding displacement, and the work done by each force

<activity xml:id="class_work-tables">
	<title>Work Tables</title>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		For each situation: (1) draw a free-body diagram, 
		(2) make a qualitative Work Table to determine if the work done by each force is positive, negative, or zero, 
		and (3) determine if the net work is positive, negative, or zero
