    <title>The Stunt Car</title>
  <p></p>
      <p>
        A stationary stunt car has an ejector seat that rests on a compressed vertical spring.  
        When the spring is released, the seat with its passenger is launched out of the car and into the air.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Explain why you might want to include the Earth and the spring in your system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider three instants in time: (1) just before the seat is released, (2) when the spring is at equilibrium, and (3) the person reaches maximum height.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Write a qualitative description of how the energy of the system transforms through these three instants.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Sketch the car and the ejector seat at each instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write an equation for each energy at each instant. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Use them to determine the maximum height of the passenger and the speed as the passenger leaves the ejector seat.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sense of your answers!
