	<title>Momentum Vector Diagram</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
	<p>A momentum vector diagram shows the momentum of each object in a system at some initial and later time.  Typically, you should also include the system's total momentum and any changes in momentum.</p>

				<title>A Simple Collision</title>
				
				
				<p></p>
<p>Two objects are moving toward each other.  Object 1 has a larger mass and is initially moving to the right.  Object 2 has a smaller mass and is initially moving to the left.  They collide and end up not moving!  Draw and label a momentum vector diagram for this context.</p>
