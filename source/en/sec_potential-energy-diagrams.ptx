	<statement>
		<p></p>
	<p>A potential energy diagram is a graph of the potential energy <m>U(x)</m> vs. <m>x</m> for some system of interest.  It is also often useful to indicate the total energy of a system.</p>

	<title>Spring Potential Energy Diagram</title>
	<introduction>
	<p>
		
	</p>
			<p>A block on a frictionless, horizontal table is connected to a spring (the other end of the spring is fixed to a wall).  The spring is initially compressed from its equilibrium position by a distance of <m>x_i</m>.</p>
</introduction>
			<task>
			<statement>
			  <p>Sketch and label a potential energy diagram for this system.</p>
				</statement>
				<hint>
				<p>Recall the definition of the spring potential energy from <xref ref="def_spring-potential-energy"></xref>.</p>
				</hint>
			</task>
			<task>
			<statement>
			<p>On your diagram, find the location(s) where the potential energy is (a) largest and (b) smallest.  Explain how you can tell from the diagram.</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
			<p>If you have not done so already, sketch the total energy on your diagram.  How does the total energy change as the block moves?</p>
			</hint>
			</task>
			<task>
			<p>On your diagram, find the location(s) where the kinetic energy is (a) largest and (b) smallest.  Explain how you can tell from the diagram.</p>
			</task>
						<task>
			<p>On your diagram, find the location(s) where the spring force is (a) largest and (b) smallest.  Do you think there is a way to tell this from the diagram alone?</p>
