			<title>Soccer Player II</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
					<p>The ball from the previous problem is then kicked back towards the player, so that it is now traveling in the opposite direction with the same speed. Has the linear momentum of the ball changed? When the ball was kicked back towards the player, if the foot was in contact with the ball for <m>0.22 \mathrm{~s}</m>, what was the magnitude of the impulse that acted on the ball?</p>
				</statement>
				<answer>
					<p>Yes, the same mass but a different velocity means a different linear momentum.</p>
