			<title>Repulsive Force</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
				<p>Two objects exert a (conservative) force on each other that is repulsive. For example, the force on object 1 from object 2 points away from object 2.  If the two objects move toward each other, does the potential energy of the two objects <em>increase</em>, <em>decrease</em>, or <em>stay the same</em>?</p>

			<title>Apple on a Spring</title>
			<statement>
				<p></p>
				<p>You have a vertical spring with constant <m>k</m>, which is initially neither stretched nor compressed.  
					You attach an apple (mass <m>m</m>) to the spring and release it from rest at <m>t = 0</m>.  
					The apple moves downward, and then comes to rest momentarily at some later time after falling some distance.  
					Determine the distance the apple has fallen.</p>

			<title>Falling Block</title>
				<statement>
					<p></p>
					<p>Shown in the figure below are two blocks connected by an ideal string that passes over a massless, frictionless pulley.  
						The mass of the larger block sits on a flat, frictionless table, and has four times the mass of the smaller block, 
						which hangs vertically. Determine the speed of each block when the larger block reaches the edge of the table, 
						a distance of <m>0.75 \mathrm{~m}</m>.</p>
