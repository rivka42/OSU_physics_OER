        <title>Pulling a Sled</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
		    <p>You decide to pull a <m>150 \mathrm{~kg}</m> sled across an icy pond that is <m>24 \mathrm{~m}</m> across.  
				You start pulling with a constant force of <m>200 \mathrm{~N}</m>.  
				When you get halfway across the pond, you hear the ice cracking and decide to increase your force so that 
				it increases linearly with distance, eventually reaching <m>500 \mathrm{~N}</m> when you get to the other side 
				of the pond.  How fast is the sled moving when you reach the other side?  </p>

				<p>You are an astronaut in charge of defending a space station from a small, incoming meteor.

Once again, you are able to stop both meteors right before they hit the space station, but only by setting your space station to exert a force on Meteor 2 that is twice as large as the force on Meteor 1.
