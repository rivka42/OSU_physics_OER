        <title>Stopping a Meteor I</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>You are an astronaut in charge of defending a space station from a small, incoming meteor.  The meteor has mass <em>m</em> and speed <em>v</em>, is initially a distance <em>d</em> from the space station, and is moving directly at the space station.  Your space station can exert a constant force on the meteor.  What force must you exert if you are to stop the meteor before it hits the space station?</p>

        <title>Stopping a Meteor II</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>After you save the space station from the meteor, you detect two new incoming meteors: both meteors have the same mass and start the same distance away from the space station.  Once again, you are able to stop both meteors right before they hit the space station, but only by setting your space station to exert a force on Meteor 2 that is twice as large as the force on Meteor 1.  Based on this, was the initial speed of Meteor 2 <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the initial speed of Meteor 1?</p>

        <title>Pulling a Sled</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>You decide to pull a 150-kg sled across an icy pond that is 24 m across.  You start pulling with a constant force of 200 N.  When you get halfway across the pond, you hear the ice cracking and decide to increase your force so that it increases linearly with distance, eventually reaching 500 N when you get to the other side of the pond.  How fast is the sled moving when you reach the other side?  </p>
