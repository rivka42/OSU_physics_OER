  <title>Density</title>
	
	<p>
		In <xref ref="sec_N1L"/>, you learned about the mass as a property of an object.  
		In some situations, you may care about how that mass is distributed in space, 
		which is useful to describe using a new quantity known as density.

	<statement>
		<p>
			
		</p>
	<p>
		The <term>mass density</term> of an object, <m>\rho</m>, can be found by dividing the object's mass by its volume: <me>
			\rho = \frac{m}{V}
		</me>
		
	</p>
	</statement>
	</definition>

	<note>
		<title>1D and 2D Density</title>
		<p>
			The symbol <m>\rho</m> represents the volume (three-dimensional) mass density.  
			Physics also commonly makes use of surface (two-dimensional) mass density, symbolized by <m>\sigma</m>, 
			and linear (one-dimensional) mass density, symbolized by <m>\lambda</m>.

				<p>
					One cup of water has a mass of approximately <m>240 \mathrm{~g}</m>.  
					Use this to estimate the density of water.  
					Make sure to convert your final answer to SI units, and comment on whether or not this number makes sense.

			<title>Sensemaking: Covariation</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					
				</p>
				<p>
					Density depends on two quantities: mass and volume.  
					Use the covariational reasoning sensemaking strategy to check that the definition for density makes sense given your everyday experience.
