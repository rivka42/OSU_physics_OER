  <title>Density</title>
	
	<p>
		In <xref ref="sec_N1L"/>, you learned about <alert>mass</alert> as a property of an object.  
		In some situations, you might care about <alert>density</alert>, which describes how mass is distributed in space.

	<title>Mass Density</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
		</p>
	<p>
		The <term>mass density</term> of an object, <m>\rho</m>, can be found by dividing the object's mass by its volume: <me>
			\rho = \frac{m}{V}
		</me>
		
	</p>
	</statement>
	</definition>

	<note>
		<title>1D and 2D Density</title>
		<p>
			The symbol <m>\rho</m> represents the volume (three-dimensional) mass density.  
			Physics also commonly makes use of surface (two-dimensional) mass density, symbolized by <m>\sigma</m>, 
			and linear (one-dimensional) mass density, symbolized by <m>\lambda</m>.

				<p>
					One cup of water has a mass of approximately <m>240 \mathrm{~g}</m>.  
					Use this to estimate the density of water.  
					Make sure to convert your final answer to SI units, and comment on whether or not this number makes sense.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					The density of water is approximately <m>1000 \mathrm{~kg/m^3}</m> or <m>1 \mathrm{~g/mL}</m>.

			<title>Sensemaking: Covariation</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					
				</p>
				<p>
					Density depends on two quantities: mass and volume.  
					Use the covariational reasoning sensemaking strategy to check that the definition for density makes sense given your everyday experience.

				<p>
					Suppose you find a rock that breaks into two parts, each of which has the same volume <m>V_o</m>.  
					You are able to determine that one part has density <m>\rho_1</m>, while the other has density <m>\rho_2</m>.  
					Write an equation for the mass of the entire rock.
