		    <p>Identical ideal springs are initially compressed and connected to two boxes with different masses <m>(m_1 \gt m_2)</m>, as shown in the figure below.  
				Each block is released from rest and allowed to move until it stops speeding up.  
				Consider system 1 consisting of block 1 and its corresponding spring and system 2 consisting of block 2 and its corresponding spring.</p>

    <p>
      You have now learned several different ways to analyze a context: forces, energy, and momentum.  
	  All three of them are valid, but they are not all equally useful in different situations.  
	  Write a few sentences summarizing when and how you want to use each strategy going forward.
