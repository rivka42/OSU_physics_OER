	<p>The potential energy for an ideal spring is <me>U_{spring} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2</me> where <m>x</m> is the 
		displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. </p>

			  <p>Many mattresses can be approximated as ideal springs.  
			  Estimate the potential energy stored in a mattress with <m>k = 24,000 \mathrm{~N/m}</m> 
			  when one person lies down on the mattress and compresses it by <m>2 \mathrm{~cm}</m>.</p>
