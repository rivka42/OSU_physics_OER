	<title>Spring Potential Energy</title>
	<statement>
	<p>The potential energy for an ideal spring is <me>U_{spring} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2</me> where <m>x</m> is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. </p>

<title>Explanation</title>
			  <p>Is the following statement true or false: “If you compress or extend the same spring by the same distance, the potential energy stored in the spring is the same.”  Explain your reasoning.</p>

<title>Calculation</title>
<statement>
			  <p>Many mattresses can be approximated as ideal springs.  Estimate the potential energy stored in such a mattress when one person lies down on the mattress.</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>Try searching “mattress spring constant” and estimating the distance a mattress might compress from everyday experience.</p>
