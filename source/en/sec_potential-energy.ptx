  <title>Potential Energy</title>
	
	<p>Start by watching the video, in which a bungee cord<fn>a bungee cord can be treated like a spring or a rubber band</fn> is initially at rest at its equilibrium position.  Then, an instructor pulls on both ends of the cord for a short time, ending with the cord stretched but at rest.  Consider the system consisting only of the bungee cord.</p>

			<exercise>
<title>Explanation: Work</title>
<p></p>
			  <p>The work done by each hand is positive (and thus, the net work on the system is positive). Explain why this must be true using our definition for work.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
<title>Explanation: Total Energy</title>
<p></p>
			  <p>Is the change in total energy of the system positive, negative, or zero?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
<title>Explanation: Energy Forms</title>
<p></p>
			  <p>If you answered that the total energy of the system changes, what is the form of that energy in the system? If you answered that the total energy of the system stays the same, were there any changes in energy outside the system?</p>
