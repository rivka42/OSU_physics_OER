  <title>Sinusoidal Waves</title>
			
  	
<p>Waves can be any shape or size, and do not necessarily have a regular, smooth, repeating shape. However, if a wave source oscillates with simple harmonic motion, then the wave that is generated will be a <alert>sinusoidal wave</alert>. </p>

<p>
The displacement of a particle in the medium depends on both the particle's position, x and the time, t when you observe it. We represent the displacement of a sinusoidal wave

<me> D(x,t) = A sin(kx - \omega t +\phi_0)</me>

			<title>Graphing Phase</title>
			  <p>In the video, you probably noticed the letter <m>\phi</m> (phi) to represent a phase inside of a sine or cosine function.  Using a graphing program (like Desmos or Mathematica), try graphing the following functions:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>\sin{x}</li>
				<li>\sin{x + \frac{\pi}{3}}</li>
				<li>\sin{x + \frac{\pi}{6}}</li>
				<li>\sin{x - \frac{\pi}{3}}</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Based on your graphs, what is the mathematical role of the phase in an oscillation or wave equation?  What do you think the physical role of the phase is?</p>
