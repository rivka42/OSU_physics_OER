<video youtube="XfU7KmKRt8M"><description>Describing relative phase for interference.</description></video>

<p>
The phase difference between two waves that gives rise to interference can be due to two sources:
<ol>
<li> The initial (natural) phase difference, arising from the where in its cycle each wave begins</li>
<li> The path length difference, <m>\Delta D</m>: the difference in distances traveled by the two waves from their source to the point of interference.</li>
</ol>
The phase difference due to a path length difference can be calculated as
<me>\Delta \phi = 2\pi\frac{\Delta D}{\lambda}</me>
Often, the initial (natural) phase difference is 0, in which case interference will be entirely due to the path length difference.

	<principle  xml:id="def_constructive">
	<title>Maximum Constructive Interference</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>If the initial phase difference between two waves is zero, maximum constructive interference occurs at locations in space where the path length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength <me>\Delta D = 0, \pm \lambda, \pm 2\lambda, ...</me>
		which is frequently simplified to, for integer <m>m</m>:
			<me>\Delta D = m \lambda</me>
		
		</p>
	</statement>
</principle>

	<principle xml:id="def_destructive">
	<title>Complete Destructive Interference</title>
	<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>If the initial phase difference between two waves is zero, complete destructive interference occurs at locations in space where the path length difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength <me>\Delta D = \pm \lambda/2, \pm 3\lambda/2, ...</me>
		which is frequently simplified to, for integer <m>m</m>:
			<me>\Delta D = (m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda</me>

				<title>Halfway Between</title>
				
				
				<statement>
					<p></p>
			  <p>You are standing halfway between two sources of waves with the same frequency and amplitude.  You observe destructive interference at your location.  Explain how this is possible.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						If you are standing halfway between the two sources of waves, the path length difference is zero.  If the waves were naturally in phase with each other, then you would see maximum constructive interference here.  But since you are seeing maximum destruction interference, the waves must have been out of phase to begin with!

						<introduction>
							<p></p>
			  <p>Two waves with the same initial phase, frequency, and amplitude reach you by traveling different distances.  One wave traveled <m>4 \mathrm{~m}</m> to reach you and the other wave traveled <m>5.5 \mathrm{~m}</m> to reach you.</p>
