<video youtube="XfU7KmKRt8M"><description>Describing relative phase for interference.</description></video>

<p>
The phase difference between two waves that gives rise to interference can be due to two sources:
<ol>
<li> The initial (natural) phase difference, arising from the where in its cycle each wave begins</li>
<li> The path length difference, <m>\Delta D</m>: the difference in distances traveled by the two waves from their source to the point of interference.</li>
</ol>
The phase difference due to a path length difference can be calculated as
<me>\Delta \phi = 2\pi\frac{\Delta D}{\lambda}</me>
Often, the initial (natural) phase difference is 0, in which case interference will be entirely due to the path length difference.

	<principle>
	<title>Maximum Constructive Interference</title>
	<statement>
		<p>If the initial phase difference between two waves is zero, maximum constructive interference occurs at locations in space where the path length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength <me>\Delta D = 0, \pm \lambda, \pm 2\lambda, ...</me></p>
	</statement>
</principle>

	<principle>
	<title>Complete Destructive Interference</title>
	<statement>
		<p>If the initial phase difference between two waves is zero, complete destructive interference occurs at locations in space where the path length difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength <me>\Delta D = \pm \lambda/2, \pm 3\lambda/2, ...</me></p>
	</statement>
</principle>

			<exercise>
			  <p>You are standing halfway between two sources of waves with the same frequency and amplitude.  You observe destructive interference at your location.  Explain how this is possible.</p>
			</exercise>
						<exercise>
						<statement>
			  <p>Two waves with the same initial phase, frequency, and amplitude reach you by traveling different distances.  One wave traveled <m>4 \mathrm{~m}</m> to reach you and the other wave traveled <m>5.5 \mathrm{~m}</m> to reach you.  The wavelength is <m>0.5 \mathrm{~m}</m>.  What kind of interference do you see?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
