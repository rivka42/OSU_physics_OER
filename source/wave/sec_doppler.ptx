			  <p>You hear a loud noise.  Which wave property (frequency, wavelength, wave speed, amplitude, wave number, phase, etc.) do you think is related to the pitch?</p>

	<p>The frequency of a sound wave changes if there is relative motion between the emitter and the listener.</p>

	<title>The Doppler Effect</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The frequency of a sound wave heard by a listener is not always the same as the frequency created by the emitter: <me>f_{\text{listener}} = f_{\text{emitter}}\frac{\nu_{\text{sound}} + v_{\text{listener}}}{\nu_{\text{sound}} - v_{\text{emitter}}}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>
Both velocities are positive if the emitter and listener are moving closer to each other but negative if they are moving away from each other, relative to the medium through which the wave is moving.  As you saw previously, the speed of sound in air is about 343 m/s.
