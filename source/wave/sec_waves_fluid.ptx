  <title>Waves in a Fluid</title>
		
<p>
A sound wave is a sequence of <alert> compressions</alert> where the density is greater than the average and <alert> rarefactions </alert> where the density is below the average density in the fluid. The fluid can be air, water or some other substance.

<p>
Consider a fluid that has density <m> \rho </m>. The wave disturbance travels outward from the source of the wave through the fluid at the wave speed <m> \nu </m> which depends on the compressibility of that fluid. A fluid's compressibility is characterized by it's <alert> bulk modulus </alert> <m> B </m>. The SI units of bulk modulus are the units of pressure, <m> Pascals</m>. If pressure  <m> P </m> is applied to a fluid of volume <m> V </m> then the fraction by which it is compressed is 

<me> \frac{\Delta V}{V}= - \frac{P}{B}</me> 

where the negative sign tells us that the volume decreases as the fluid is compressed. You can predict the speed of sound in a fluid, which is the speed at which the compression wave travels

<me> \nu_{\text{sound}} = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} </me>

At <m> 0^{\circ} C</m> and 1.0 atmosphere standard pressure, the density of air is <m> \rho_0 = 1.292 kg/m^3 </m> and the bulk modulus is <m> B_0=1.48 x 10^5 Pa </m>. Thus the speed of sound in air is 

<me> \nu_{\text{sound}} = \sqrt{\frac{B_0}{\rho_0}}=331 \text{m/s} </me>

You can use the ideal gas law to show that density at constant pressure is inversely proportional to the temperature <m> T </m> measured in Kelvins. Therefore the sound in air at 1.0 atmosphere standard pressure is 

<me> \nu_{\text{sound}}(T) = \sqrt{\frac{B_0}{\rho_0}\frac{T}{273}} = 331 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \sqrt{\frac{T}{273}}</me>
