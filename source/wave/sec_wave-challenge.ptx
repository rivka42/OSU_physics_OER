		<title>Diving Bird</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				You hear a loud noise at <m>900 \mathrm{~Hz}</m> and look up to see a bird diving toward you. You are able to identify the type of bird and you know that they usually make noise at around <m>800 \mathrm{~Hz}</m>. How fast is the bird moving?

		<title>Flash of Lightning</title>
		<statement>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				You see a flash of lightning strike a clock tower during a thunderstorm. You count <m>2.5 \mathrm{~s}</m> between when the lightning flashes and when you hear thunder with a sound level of <m>70 \mathrm{~dB}</m>. What is the sound level of the thunder for someone standing only <m>20 \mathrm{~m}</m> from the clock tower?

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection: Waves</title>
<p></p>
<p>The model you have been building for waves is an extension of the model for oscillations.  Identify one key feature of the wave model that is <em>the same as</em> and another key feature of the wave model that is <em>different from</em> the oscillation model.  For each feature, write a short (2-3) sentence reflection about how the models are similar and/or different.</p>
