  <title>Representing Waves</title>
			
  	
<p>A first step in building a <alert> wave model </alert> is to consider different representations (words, graphs, equations, <em>etc.</em>) to help describe the behaviors of waves.  While the figure below shows actual waves in time and space, simplified graphical representations will be more useful.
</p>

<title>History Graphs</title>
</exercises>

<p>When modeling the motion of point particles, you primarily used a <xref ref="rep_motion-graphs" text="title" /> to show, for example, the position of an object across many different instants in time.  This sort of graph can still be used to show the motion of <em>one position</em> in a medium over time.  This is known as a <alert>history graph</alert>.</p>

<lemma xml:id="rep_history-graph">
			<title>History Graph</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A <term>history graph</term> is a graph of wave motion showing the position of a fixed part of a medium over time.</p>
			</statement>
		</lemma>
    
<p>
When you have a history graph, a quantity of note is the <alert>period</alert> <m>T</m>: the time it takes to complete one full oscillation.  As in simple harmonic motion, the period is related to the frequency by 

<me> T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}</me>

Another quantity of note is the amplitude: the maximum displacement away from equilibrium of a particle in the medium. 
</p>

<title>Snapshot Graphs</title>
</exercises>

<p>
Alternatively, you can graph the displacement of the medium over space at a single instant in time, creating a <alert>snapshot graph</alert>. 
</p>

<lemma xml:id="rep_snapshot-graph">
			<title>Snapshot Graph</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A <term>snapshot graph</term> is a graph of wave motion showing the position of all parts of a medium at a fixed time.</p>
			</statement>
		</lemma>

<p> 
Now, the quantity of note is the <em>distance</em> spanned from one crest of the wave to the next, or the <alert> wavelength </alert>, symbolized by <m> \lambda </m>.
</p>

<observation>
<title>Wave Number</title>
<p>
Recall from simple harmonic motion the relationship between angular frequency, frequency, and period,

<me> \omega = 2 \pi f = \frac{2 \pi}{T} </me> 

Time is the physical quantity that connects angular frequency, frequency and period. There is an analogous spatial relationship between wavelength and a quantity called the <alert> wavenumber </alert> <m> k </m>

<me> k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} </me>

The wavenumber represents the spatial frequency of a wave over a unit distance. 
</p>
</observation>

<exercise>
<title>Exploring Wavenumber</title>
<p>A friend tells you about a wave with wavenumber <m>k = \frac{4\pi}{7} \mathrm{~\frac{rad}{m}}</m>.  What is the wavelength of this wave?  What would the wavenumber be for a different wave with double the wavelength?</p>
