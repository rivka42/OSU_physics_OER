   <p>Humans have a very wide range of hearing when measuring intensity in units of Watts per meter.
      For this reason, a logarithmic unit of measurement called sound intensity level is often used for 
      measuring loudness. The unit for sound intensity level is the bel or decibel (dB).</p>

   <title>Sound intensity level</title>
   <statement>
	   <p>The <term>intensity level</term> of sound is defined to be: <me>\beta = (10 \text{ dB}) \log_{10} \frac{I}{I_0}</me><me>I_0 = 10^{-12} \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2}</me></p>
	</statement>
   </definition>

   <p><m>I_0</m> is a very small intensity, at the lower limit of human hearing. When <m>I = I_0</m>, it dose not mean there are no sound waves present, just that humans cannot hear them.</p>

   <p>When the sound intensity level increases by 10 dB, the intensity increases by a factor of ten. You start to feel pain from high intensity sound at about 130 dB</p>
