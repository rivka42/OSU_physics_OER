   <title>Loudness</title>

   <p>Humans have a verywide range of hearing when measuring intensity in units of Watts per meter.
      For this reason, we often use a logarithmic unit of measurement called sound intensity level for 
      measuring sound. The unit for sound intensity level is bel.</p>

   <title>Sound intensity level</title>
   <statement>
	   <p>The <term>intensity level</term> of sound is defined to be: <me>\beta = (10 dB) log_{10} \frac{I}{I_0}</me><me>I_0 = 10^{-12} \frac{W}{m^2}</me></p>
	</statement>
   </definition>

   <p>We define <m>I_0</m> to be a very small intensity, at the lower limit of human hearing. When <m>I = I_0</m>, it doesn't mean that there are no sound waves present, just that humans cannot hear them.</p>

   <p>When the sound intensity level increases by a factor of 10 dB, the intensity increases by a factor of ten. We start to feel pain from high intensity sound at about 130 dB</p>
