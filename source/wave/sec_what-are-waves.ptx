<p> A <alert>wave</alert> is a disturbance which travels through a medium. As the wave travels through the medium, particles that make up the medium may experience local oscillations as the wave passes, but it is important to note that the particles in the medium <alert>do not</alert> travel with the wave. You may ask, if the medium is not traveling with the disturbance, then what is? A wave disturbance carries <alert>energy</alert> from point to point in the medium. </p>
