  <title>What Are Waves</title>
  
<p> A <alert>mechanical wave</alert> is an organized disturbance which travels through a material or a <alert>medium</alert>. This medium could be air, water, a guitar string or the fluid that makes up the core of the Earth. Any medium that can sustain a wave must have some elasticity. As a wave disturbance propagates through a medium, the particles that make up the medium are displaced away from equilibrium and experience local oscillations. However, it is important to note that the particles in the medium <alert>do not</alert> travel with the wave.  </p>

<p> 
 The medium has some restoring force, such as tension in a string or viscous forces in water which allows the medium experience local oscillations as the wave passes. 
</p>

<p> 
A wave disturbance is created by a <alert> source </alert>. The source of waves are external oscillations of the medium. This could be in the form of a finger plucking a string, or a rock tossed into a pond. Once the medium has been disturbed, a wave propagates away from the source of that disturbance at a particular speed called the <alert> wave speed </alert>. This wave speed depends on the properties of the medium, and particularly, restoring forces provided by the elasticity of the medium such as tension in a plucked string or cohesion in water. 
</p>

<p>
A <alert> transverse wave </alert> is a wave in which the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction that the disturbance travels. 
</p>

    		<image source="wave/stringpulse.gif" width = "75%" ></image>
    </figure>


<p>
A <alert> longitudinal wave </alert> is a wave in which the displacement of the medium is parallel to the direction that the disturbance travels. 
</p>

    		<image source="wave/wavepulse.gif" width = "75%" ></image>
    </figure>


<p>
You may ask, if the medium is not traveling with the disturbance, then what is? A wave disturbance carries <alert> energy </alert> and <alert> momentum </alert> from point to point in the medium.
