          <p>You hear a loud noise.  Which wave property or properties (frequency, wavelength, wave speed, amplitude, wave number, phase, etc.) do you think is related to how loud it is?</p>

<p>Consider a transverse wave on a horizontal string. Any point along the string moves up and down as a wave passes through it. The average speed of a point on the string is related to the amplitude of the wave and also to how quickly the motion changes from up to down â€“ thus the frequency.</p>

<p>
	<me> K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</me>
	<me> E \propto f^2 A^2</me>
</p>

<p>
The kinetic energy of the mass at that point depends on the square of the speed. We can infer that the energy of the wave goes as the square of the amplitude, and the square of the frequency.

    </p>
	   <p>The <term>intensity</term> of a wave emanating from a point source is the power per unit area: <me>I = \frac{P}{\text{Area}}</me> where <m>P</m> is power and the area is the surface area of a sphere.</p>
   </statement>

<observation>
  <title>Spherical Wave Intensity</title>
  <p>For a point source wave, emanating as a spherical wave front, the area is the surface area of a sphere. Intensity takes the form: <me>I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}</me>
</p>

        Energy from a point source decreases as the surface area of the sphere increases.

<p>
You can visualize this by considering the energy passing through a small area of a sphere of radius <m>r</m>. The same amount of energy must pass through a larger area of a sphere of radius <m>2r</m>. Since the surface area of the larger sphere increases by a factor of <m>r^2</m>, the energy passing through the same area must be <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> as much.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>Your friend is a distance <m>d</m> from a point source of sound and measures the intensity of the sound wave to be <m>I</m>.  How far away from the source of the wave do you need to be to measure the intensity to be <m>\frac{I}{2}</m>?</p>
