  <title>Waves on a String</title>
  
  
<p>
A mechanical wave is an organized disturbance which travels outward from the source of the wave through a medium at the wave speed <m> \nu </m>. Let's consider a stretched string of length <m> L </m>, mass <m> m </m>, with tension <m> T_s </m>, and <alert> linear density </alert> <m> \mu_s</m> where 

<me> \mu_s = \frac{m}{L}</me>

is the mass-to-length ratio of the string. The wave speed <m> \nu </m>

<me> \nu_{string} = \sqrt{\frac{T_s}{\mu_s}} </me>

depends on the tension which serves as a restoring force for the medium and the linear density of the string.

<title>Sensemaking: Units of wave speed</title>
<statement>
<p>
Explicitly check the units of <m> \nu_{string} </m> to confirm its relationship holds.  
</p>
</statement>
<answer>
<p>
Let's perform a quick unit check:

<me> m/s = sqrt{N/(kg/m)} = sqrt{\frac{(kg*m/s^2)}{(kg/m)}}=sqrt{\frac{m^2}{s^2}} = m/s </me>

Indeed, the units are consistent.
