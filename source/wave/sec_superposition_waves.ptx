	<exercise>
	<p>Predict what you think the shape of the string will look like as the wave pulses continue to move on the string.  Sketch a few diagrams showing the string at a few different instants in time.  Explain your reasoning.</p>

	<p>When two or more waves meet, they do not typically impact each other, but they do work together to influence the resulting displacement of the medium.</p>
	
	<principle>
	<title>Wave Superposition</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The total displacement caused by multiple waves can be determined by adding the displacements caused by each wave.  The displacements have to be added separately at every point in space and time.</p>
	</statement>
</principle>
