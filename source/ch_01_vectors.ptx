  <title>Vectors</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
Vector analysis is an important aspect of quantifying motion that occurs in more than one physical dimension. Driving a car on a flat surface is an example of motion in two dimensions, whereas, flying a plane through the air is an example of three-dimensional motion.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
Let's begin your study of motion by gaining a foundational understanding of what vectors are and how to represent them visually and mathematically.

    <p>After successful completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
 <ol>
<li>Explain the difference between a vector and a scalar</li>
<li>List common vectors and scalars</li>
<li>Represent vectors using multiple representations (diagrams, graphs, words, equations)</li>
<li>Resolve a vector into components</li>
<li>Define and use unit vector notation</li>
<li>Add and subtract vectors graphically and mathematically</li>
<li>Multiply a vector by a scalar quantity</li>
<li>Take the dot product between two vectors</li>
<li>Move between the component representation and the magnitude and direction angle representation of vectors. </li>
</ol>
