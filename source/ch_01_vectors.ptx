  <title>Vectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
Vector analysis is an important aspect of quantifying motion that occurs in more than one physical dimension. Driving a car on the surface of the planet is an example of motion in two dimensions, whereas, flying a plane through some volume of atmosphere is an example of three-dimensional motion.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
Let's begin your study of motion by gaining a foundational understanding of what vectors are and how to represent them visually and mathematically.
