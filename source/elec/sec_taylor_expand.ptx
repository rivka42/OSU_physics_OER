	<title>Approximation Techniques in Physics</title>

  	<p>
Effectively applying approximation techniques will be a valuable skill in this course and beyond. Many approximations involve a dimensionless quantity being very small. Recall the small angle approximation, where if <m> \theta \ll 1</m>, then we can approximate  <m> sin \theta \approx tan \theta \approx \theta </m> and <m> cos \theta \approx 1</m>. This was a direct result of applying a Taylor expansion to the trigonometric functions.

			The <term>Taylor series</term> or Taylor expansion of a function <m> f(x) </m> is an infinite sum of powers of the function's derivatives where each term is a polynomial of degree <m> n</m>. If the function <m> f(x) </m> is a real or complex valued function that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex value <m> x=a</m> then the function can be expanded as 
			
			<me> f(x) = f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2+... \Sigma_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n
			</me>
			
where <m> n! </m> denotes the factorial of <m> n</m> and <m> f^{(n)}(a)</m> denotes the nth derivative of the function <m> f(x) </m>evaluated at <m> x=a</m>.

		</exercises>
	<p> 
A binomial is, as the word implies,  two numbers added together and sometimes raised to a power. The binomial approximation is a useful mathematical tool for simplifying or approximating symbolic expressions that involve two lengths that are added together when one is much, much larger than the other. Suppose we have an expression where the quantity <m> x \ll 1</m>, and <m> x </m> is a dimensionless quantity, then we can perform a binomial expansion to expand the function in powers of the small quantity <m> x </m>. 
	<me> (1+x)^n \approx 1+nx+ \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^2+ ...</me> 
	
Where the term <m> nx</m> is called the first order term, and the term containing the <m> x^2</m> is called the second order term and so on.
