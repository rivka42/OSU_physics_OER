	<p>Electric fields exist everywhere in space. The motion of charged objects through space is governed by any pre-existing electric fields. You can understand this motion by analyzing the force applied to a charged object due to an electric field.</p>

		<statement>
			<p>The <term>electric force</term> on a pointlike object is the product of the object's charge and the electric field at the location of the object: <me>\vec{F}^E = q_{\text{test}} \vec{E}</me></p>

			<title>Fields in Science</title>
			  <p>An electric field is a <em>field</em>, which means it has a potentially different value everywhere in space.  Identify one other quantity you are familiar with that could be described as a field.  It can be from physics or from another science, or from your everyday experience.  Explain why you believe the quantity you chose is a field.</p>
