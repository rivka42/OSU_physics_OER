<p>
Charged particles are all around us and each charge generates an electric field. Electric fields exist everywhere in space. The motion of charged objects through space is governed by any pre-existing electric fields. We can begin to understand this motion by analyzing the force applied to a charged object due to an electric field.

Charged particles interact with each other through electric fields. The electric force and the gravitational force are both long range forces. This means that the object's experiencing Newton's third law pair forces, either gravitational or electric, do not need to be in direct contact with each other to exert forces on each other. The electric and gravitational fields are responsible for mediating the force interaction between masses and charges.  Much of what we do in exploring electric fields has a direct analogue with gravitational fields. Keep this in mind as we progress through the next few chapters.

Each and every electric charge generates its own electric field. We can think of the electric field as a physical alteration of the space around a charge which describes the influence of that charge on other charges in their vicinity. We usually call the charge generating the field the <em> source charge</em>, and represent it mathematically as <m> q_{source}</m>, and the charge experiencing the field the <em> test charge</em> and represent it <m> q_{test}</m>. A source charge never feels a force from its own field. It would violate conservation of energy for a charge to be able to exert a force on itself through its own field.

			The electric field of a single point charge is defined mathematically as <me> \vec{E}(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac {q}{r^2} \hat{r}</me> where <m> q </m> represents the source charge generating the field, <m> r </m> is the distance from the point to the location we want to know the magnitude of the field and <m> \hat{r} </m> is a unit vector that points radially away from the charge, and <m> \epsilon_{0} = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2</m> is the <em> permittivity constant </em>.

<p>
To understand this definition let's use a visual representation to be precise about what each symbol of the equation means physically. Consider a charge <m> q </m> and a point in space <m> P </m> a distance <m> r </m> away from charge <m> q </m>. In analyzing the notation <m> \vec{E}(r) </m> we see the vector symbol above the <m> E</m> which tells us that the electric field is a vector and it depends on, or is a function of, the distance <m> r </m> from the center of the charge <m> q </m> that creates the field. The field is defined at any point in space around the charge, and its magnitude changes with the inverse square of distance from that charge. To find the direction of the field, we use the unit vector <m> \hat{r} </m> which always points from center of the charge radially outward.  When we multiply the magnitude of the electric field by the unit vector <m> \hat{r} </m>, we can find the direction of the field at point <m> P </m>. Recall that a unit vector itself has magnitude <m> |\hat{r}|=1.0 </m> and so multiplying the equation by <m> \hat{r} </m> does not change the overall magnitude, it only imparts a directionality to the field at that point. If we chose a different point in space around the charge, the electric field both magnitude and direction would be different depending on that position. This is yet another reason for suing the notation <m> \vec{E}(r) </m> suggesting the electric field is a <em > function of position </em>.

Let's also discuss the permittivity constant <m> \epsilon_{0} = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2</m>. Electric fields are generated by charges. If there is other matter around that charge, for example air or wood or water, that matter can affect how the electric field is <em> permitted </em> to exist. The constant <m> \epsilon_{0} </m> is a constant of proportionality which scales how the magnitude of the electric field is related to charge and distance in a <em> vacuum </em>. This is why it is sometimes referred to as the <em> permittivity of free space </em> or the <em> vacuum permittivity</em>. If there is other matter in the vicinity of the source charge, then the magnitude of the electric field will be slightly different because the field needs to be <em> permitted</em> by matter.

			<title>Fields in Science</title>
			  <p>An electric field is a <em>field</em>, which means it has a potentially different value everywhere in space.  Identify one other quantity you are familiar with that could be described as a field.  It can be from physics or from another science, or from your everyday experience.  Explain why you believe the quantity you chose is a field.</p>
