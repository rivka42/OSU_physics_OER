<p>
Charged particles are all around us and each charge generates an electric field. Electric fields exist everywhere in space. The motion of charged objects through space is governed by any pre-existing electric fields. We can begin to understand this motion by analyzing the force applied to a charged object due to an electric field.

			The <term>electric force</term> on a point-like object (test charge) is the product of the object's charge and the electric field at the location of the object: <me>\vec{F}^E = q_{\text{test}} \vec{E}</me>

Charged particles interact with each other through electric fields. Like the gravitational force, the electric force is a long range force, as opposed to a contact force. The electric and gravitational fields are responsible for mediating the force interaction between charges and masses, respectively.  Much of what we do in exploring electric fields has a direct analogue with gravitational fields. Keep this in mind as we progress through the next few chapters.

			<title>Fields in Science</title>
			  <p>An electric field is a <em>field</em>, which means it has a potentially different value everywhere in space.  Identify one other quantity you are familiar with that could be described as a field.  It can be from physics or from another science, or from your everyday experience.  Explain why you believe the quantity you chose is a field.</p>

			<title>How Flowers Talk to Bees</title>

			  <p>Watch this video describing how flowers and bees communicate. Can you think of other ways in which plants and animals might rely on, use or be affected by electric fields?
