			  <p>An electric field is a <em>field</em>, which means it has a potentially different value everywhere in space.  Identify one other quantity you are familiar with that could be described as a field.  It can be from physics or from another science, or from your everyday experience.  Explain why you believe the quantity you chose is a field.</p>
