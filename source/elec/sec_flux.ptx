	<statement>
		<p>The <term>electric flux</term> <m>\Phi_E</m> through a surface defined by infinitesimal area vector <m>d\vec{A}</m> is given by <me>\Phi_E = \int\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}</me></p>

	<p>Recall <xref ref="x_fig_book" visual="book" /> from <xref ref="x_area-book" />.</p>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Suppose the book were placed in a region with a uniform electric field that points upward: <m>\vec{E} = E_o\hat{y}</m>. If the area of the front cover is <m>A</m>, determine the electric flux through the front cover.  What happens to the integral in a case like this?</p>
			</exercise>
						<exercise>
			  <p>Suppose you know the electric field everywhere in space and your surface of interest is a sphere centered on the origin.  What is the area vector for this surface?  Outline a general procedure for finding the electric flux through this surface.  Can you think of any electric fields for which this procedure will be very challenging?  Very easy?</p>
