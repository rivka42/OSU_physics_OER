	<p>Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. Objects that are "charged" can display interesting behaviors when interacting with electric fields that we will explore in this chapter.</p>

		<statement>
			<p>Charge is a physical property, measured in coulombs (C), that governs how an object interacts with electric fields.</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>An atom always has the same number of protons as electrons.  What is the total charge on such an atom?</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>Suppose you have an object with a net charge of exactly 1.0 C.  How many more protons than electrons are in this object?  Based on this, do you think a net charge of 1.0 C is typical for an everyday object, or is it much larger or smaller than you would expect for an everyday object?</p>
