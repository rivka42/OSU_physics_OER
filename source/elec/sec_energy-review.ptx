  	<title>Review: Conservation of Energy</title>

	<p>Let's review when energy is conserved.</p>
		
	<video youtube="qMJK_sjdUCw"><description>DESCRIPTION</description></video>
	
	<p>We can determine if energy is conserved by recalling the <xref ref="p_work-energy"/> theorem. If the net work done by external forces on an object is zero, then energy (kinetic and potential) is conserved.</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>The diagrams above show two experiments involving two blocks, A and B. Which of the following statements is true about work and energy for these two systems?</p>
			
			<ol type="a">
				<li>The work done by external forces is positive for both systems.</li>
				<li>The change in total energy is positive for both systems.</li>
				<li>The change in kinetic energy is positive for both systems.</li>
				<li>The change in potential energy is negative for both systems.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Explain your reasoning for each statement.</p>

			<p>Suppose you have two positive point charges separated by some distance. A few minutes later, you find that the distance between the two point charges has increased.</p>

			<p>Do you think the potential energy of the system of both charges increased, decreased, or stayed the same? Explain your reasoning.</p>
