		<statement>
		<p>When is the total mechanical energy of a system conserved? Describe how you know.</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
		<p>Recall the <xref ref="p_work-energy"/> theorem. If the <alert>net work</alert> done by external forces on an object is zero, then total mechanical energy (kinetic and potential) is conserved.</p>

		<statement>
			<p>Consider the two experiments described below.  In each case, consider the system consisting of the apple and the Earth.</p>
			
			<p>Experiment 1: You are initially holding an apple at rest a distance <m>h</m> above the ground, and you lower the apple and place it at rest on the ground.</p>
			<p>Experiment 2: You are initially holding an apple at rest a distance <m>h</m> above the ground, and you drop the apple so that it is moving at speed <m>v_f</m> right before it hits the ground.</p>
			
			<p>Which of the following statements is true about work and energy for these two experiments?</p>
			
			<ol type="a">
				<li>The work done by external forces is positive for both systems.</li>
				<li>The change in total energy is positive for both systems.</li>
				<li>The change in kinetic energy is positive for both systems.</li>
				<li>The change in potential energy is negative for both systems.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Explain your reasoning for each statement.</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>Suppose you have two positive point charges separated by some distance. A few minutes later, you find that the distance between the two point charges has increased.</p>

			<p>Do you think the potential energy of the system of both charges increased, decreased, or stayed the same? Explain your reasoning.</p>
