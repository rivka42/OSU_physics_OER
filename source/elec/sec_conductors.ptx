			<p>The diagram above shows a large positive charge next to a conductor. A conductor is a material (typically metal) that has a lot of free charges that can move around in response to external fields. The conductor in the figure is neutral (the net charge is zero).</p>

			<p>Describe how you would expect the charges in the conductor to distribute themselves in the presence of the large positive charge.</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>Together, the large positive charge and the charges in the conductor will create a net electric field everywhere in space.  Predict the direction of this net electric field at the center of the square conductor.</p>

		<p>Has your thinking about the electric field at the center of the conductor changed? If so, explain how and why it has changed.</p>

		<statement>
			<p>A <term>conductor</term> is an object that possesses free electric charges that move in response to an external electric field in such a way that the electric field everywhere inside the conductor is zero.</p>

		<exercise>
			<p>What direction is the net electric field at each point inside the conductor?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>Do you think the electric potential difference between points A and B is positive, negative, or zero?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
