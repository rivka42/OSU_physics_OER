		<title>Sensemaking</title>
    <p>
      Physics is supposed to make sense of the real world, but sometimes it tells us surprising things that might seem to contradict our everyday experience.  Were there any situations where you observed an apparent difference between something you have experienced and something physics was telling you?  How were you able to resolve the difference?
