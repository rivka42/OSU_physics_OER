	<title>Charge Properties of Materials</title>
		
 	
<p>
As you are probably already aware, different materials interact with charges differently. You probably already know that metals are better at conducting electricity than wood or plastic. However, what you might not know is how the electronic structure of a material affects its ability to be charged and how charges behave on or within that material. What does it mean to conduct electricity and how does the atomic structure of materials lead to different charge properties? In this chapter we will explore these ideas together.

  <title>Atomic Structure</title>

<p>
We will come to understand over the next few weeks that what we call electricity is the flow of electrons through conducting wires if we are talking about the electricity that powers our homes. It is the flow of electrons through air if we are talking of lightning, or the flow of electrons through our bodies when we feel an electric shock (ouch!). Those of you who have taken (or are taking) a chemistry course have learned about the <em>periodic table of elements</em> and probably know the basics of <alert> atomic structure </alert>. Let's briefly review. A single atom is made up of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons in its nucleus. Recall the periodic table of elements is arranged by atoms with increasing numbers of protons. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons which can exist in different positions corresponding to different electron energies.

Atoms are held together by electric forces. The <em> electron configuration</em> refers to how the electrons are arranged into different energy levels, sometimes referred to as energy orbitals, within an atom or molecule. The outermost electrons, the <alert>valence electrons</alert> are responsible for much of the bonding properties of atoms. The electron configuration was first described in the Bohr Model of an atom, but as physics has progressed, we have come to understand that quantum mechanics plays a much larger role in how atoms interact than previously thought.

  <title>Insulators and conductors</title>
</exercises> 

  <p>
The charge carriers in metals are electrons. In a <alert> conductor </alert>, the outermost electrons, the valence electrons, are only very weakly bound to the nucleus by electric forces between positive and negative charges. The electrons can become detached from their parent nuclei and move freely around the atomic lattice structure of the conductor. Essentially, charge can flow in a conductor which is why they are great at conducting electricity. Examples of conductors include metals, plasmas, water and some inorganic molecules (generally, materials whose molecules undergo valence bonding, or inorganic compounds with free electrons)
</p>

<p>
<alert> Insulators</alert>, in contrast, are made from materials whose valence electrons are all tightly bound to their nucleus and cannot move freely between atoms. Charging an insulator by friction leaves patches of molecular ions on the surface but the charges are immobile, they cannot move on the surface. When excess charge is added to an insulating material, that charge cannot move. It remains in place until the charges are dissipated to the environment. Examples of insulators include glass, plastic, wood, rubber, and some organic molecules (generally, materials whose atoms undergo covalent and hydrogen bonding).

<p>
In solids, electron energy levels broaden into bands due to interactions with neighboring atoms. In a solid, the discrete energy levels of individual atoms merge into continuous bands due to the large number of atoms in a solid and the electric interactions between atoms. The <alert> valence band</alert> is the highest energy band that is completely filled with electrons. It's similar to the outermost electron orbital of an atom that is filled with electrons. The charge carriers in metals are electrons that are free to migrate in the energy band called the <alert> conduction band </alert>. The conduction band is far enough away from the positive nuclei that electrons in the conduction band can flow freely from nucleus to nucleus in the material. The <alert> band gap </alert> is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The valence and conduction bands are separated by energy gaps, or positions where electrons are forbidden to exist. </p>

<p>
In <em> conductors </em>, the valence band overlaps with the conduction band, allowing electrons to move freely and conduct electricity easily. In <em> insulators </em>, the band gap between the valence and conduction bands is very large, making it difficult for electrons to move from one band to the other. This results in charges that are immobile and materials with low electrical conductivity. In semiconductors, the band gap is relatively small, allowing some electrons to move from the valence band to the conduction band under certain conditions. This gives semiconductors intermediate conductivity between conductors and insulators. Band theory is only an approximation to the quantum state of a solid. Understanding the electrical properties of different materials is still an active field of research and study called <em> materials science</em>. Many modern companies (semi-conductor industry, solar industry, battery industry, etc., ...) are interested in hiring scientists to perform <em> materials science research </em> to understand the electric properties of materials.
