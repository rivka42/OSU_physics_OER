	<title>What Is Electricity?</title>

  	<p>We will now be investigating electric and magnetic phenomenon! We will start with electricity. What is electricity? Very loosely speaking, we can say that electricity is the flow of electric charge. What is electric charge and what phenomenon are associated with the flow of charge? How does charge flow, and what forces cause charges to move? Let's watch some physics demonstrations to get started thinking about electric phenomenon and charge.</p>

	 <p>Generally, the study of electromagnetism is broken into two parts: <alert> electricity </alert> and <alert> magnetism</alert>, focusing on electric and magnetic phenomena, respectively. Further, electrostatics as in <em> static</em>, or stationary, deals with the behaviors and properties of stationary charges while electrodynamics deals with the behaviors and properties of moving charges. We will explore more about electric and magnetic fields and how matter and charge respond to these fields in the chapters to come.</p>
