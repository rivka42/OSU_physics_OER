		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A major theme of this unit was determining how and when symmetry can help make your calculations easier. Write a short paragraph summarizing symmetry and how it can be useful when calculating the electric field. Which activities did you complete this week that you want to remember?
