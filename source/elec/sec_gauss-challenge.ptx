<statement>
			<p>
			Shown below are three different situations.  In case A, both point charges are negative.  In case B, the left point charge is positive and the right point charge is negative.  In case C, the negative charge is uniformly distributed across the circular arc.  Rank the three situations by the magnitude of the electric field at point P.  (Focus on A vs. B and A vs. C: treat B vs. C as a challenge problem only!)

		<introduction>
		<p>
		Two positive point charges <m>+q</m> are located a distance <m>L</m> apart, as shown above.  A Gaussian surface (a cube with side length <m>L</m>) is drawn with its center at the location of the left charge.

			<p>
			Is the electric flux through the right face of the cube <em>positive</em>, <em>negative</em>, or <em>zero</em>?

			b)	Suppose the charge on the right were replaced by a charge of <m>-q</m>.  Would the net electric flux through the entire cube <em>increase</em>, <em>decrease</em>, or <em>stay the same</em>?
