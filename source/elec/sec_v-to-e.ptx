		<exercise>
			<p>Given the equation you learned about in the previous section, <xref ref="e_to_v"/>, suppose you instead knew the electric potential (<m>V</m>), and you wanted to figure out the electric field (<m>E</m>). What mathematical operation could you perform on <m>V</m> to get <m>E</m>?</p>

	<p>Now you have seen how we can go back and forth between <m>V</m> and <m>E</m>. To find <m>V</m> from <m>E</m>, you can take a derivative!</p>
