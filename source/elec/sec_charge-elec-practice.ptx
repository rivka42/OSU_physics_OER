		<title>Charged Wires</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A charged wire has one end at <m>x = –L</m> and the other end at <m>x = L</m>.  The wire has a known, non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda(x) = \frac{q_o}{L^2}  x</m>.  You have an electric field generator that can make different electric fields, but when you set it to create a uniform electric field you find that the net force on the wire is 0!  Which of the following alternate settings for your electric field generator would result in a nonzero net force on the wire?
