	<statement>
		    <p>Consider a cotton sock inside a dryer machine whose drum (inner container) is made of steel.  After tumbling around in the dryer's drum for a while, the cotton sock has a net charge on it now.  Which of the following charge transfers most likely happened in this sock-drum system? </p>
				<ol marker="A">
				<li>The steel drum lost electrons while the cotton sock gained those electrons. </li>
				<li>The steel drum lost protons while the cotton sock gained those protons. </li>
				<li>The cotton sock lost electrons while the steel drum gained those electrons. </li>
				<li>The cotton sock lost protons while the steel drum gained those protons. </li>
