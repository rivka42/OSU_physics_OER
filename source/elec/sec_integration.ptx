	<p> 
	For a single point charge <m> q </m>, the magnitude of the electric field at a distance r from the center of the charge is given by <me> E(r) = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2} </me> 
The direction of the field is always radially away or toward the charge depending on whether the charge is positive or negative. The electric field of multiple charges can be found from summing over many charges by applying the principle of superposition. We assume that the charges are so numerous, we can no longer count them. Instead of counting individual charges, we describe the charge as a density of charges in one, two or three dimensions of space. Using the power of calculus, we can turn a sum into an integral

<me> E  = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{dq}{r^2} </me> 

Here, <m> r </m> is the distance from an infinitesimal amount of charge <m> dq </m> to the point we are interested in knowing the electric field magnitude. It is often useful to get in the habit of using a process for setting up these integrals	:

<ol> 
<li>
	Choose a coordinate system that matches the symmetry of the charge distribution. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Determine <m> r </m>  in terms of the coordinate system variables. Recall that <m> r </m> is the distance from an infinitesimal amount of charge <m> dq </m> to the point we are interested in knowing the electric field magnitude.
	</li>
	<li>
	Determine <m> dq </m>  in terms of a coordinate differential such as <m> dx </m>, <m> dy </m>, <m> dr </m> or <m> d\theta </m> and the charge density in one, two or three dimensions. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Determine if there are components of the field that cancel due to superposition and symmetry. 
	</li>
<li> 
Determine the bounds of integration. We need to sum over all the <em> charges </em>. 
</li>
	<li>
	Set up the integral and solve for the net electric field. 
</li>
</ol>

		<p>In a course you took previously, you learned that the moment of inertia for a point object is <m>I = mr^2</m>, where <m>r</m> is the perpendicular distance between the object and the axis of rotation.</p>
		<exercise>
			<statement>
			  	<p>Explain why the integral <m>I = \int_{0 \text{ m}}^{1.2 \text{ m}} x^2 \lambda dx</m> will give the moment of inertia for your stick if you hold it at one end and swing it in a horizontal circle.</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
				<p>One way to think about an integral is as a tool for calculating a sum.  If you want to know how many apples are on a tree, one way is to divide the tree into ten sections, count the number of apples in each section, and then add them.  However, we often want to add up things that are hard to count.  An integral is like chopping up the tree into a <em>very large number</em> of sections that are <em>very small</em>, counting the number of apples in each section, and then adding them all up.  The <m>dx</m> in an integral represents the size of one of the sections, while the integrand (the rest of the symbols inside the integral symbol) tell you how much of the thing you are counting is in one of those sections, per unit length.  Importantly, each of the small sections might have a <em>different amount</em> of whatever you are counting.</p>

			<p>Your friend has a board that is the same length as your stick (1.2 m), but that has a linear mass density that is <em>not</em> uniform: <m>\lambda(x) = 0.8 \text{ kg/m} + 0.3 x \text{ kg/m^2}</m>.  What does the board look like (<em>i.e.,</em> how is the mass distributed)?</p>
