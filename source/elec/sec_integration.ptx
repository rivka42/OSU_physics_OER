			<exercise>
			  <p>Suppose your friend has used an integral to solve a physics problem for the force on a metal plate: <me>F = \int_{-1}^{1}\int{0}^{10}\left( P_0 + \rho gy\right)dydx</me> What does the plate look like? Explain how you can tell from the integral expression.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<p>What physical quantity does the integrand <m>\left( P_0 + \rho gy\right)</m> represent? Describe how you can tell.</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<p>Why does this integral do what your friend wants it to do (find the force on a metal plate)? Why do you think your friend had to use an integral?</p>
