		<title>Coulomb's Law</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The electric field created by a point charge <m>q_{\text{source}}</m> is given by <me>\vec{E}_{pc} = \frac{kq_{\text{source}}}{r^2}\hat{r}</me>  Here <m>k = 9 \times 10^9 \frac{\text{Nm}^2}{\text{C}^2}</m> is a constant, <m>\hat{r}</m> is a unit vector that points radially outward from the location of the point charge, and <m>r</m> is the distance from the point charge to the place where the electric field is being evaluated.</p>
		</statement>

		<exercise>
			<p>Recall <xref ref="x_graphing-r-hat"/>, in which you made a 2D-map of a vector field.  The vector field you mapped is proportional to <m>\hat{r}</m>! Map this vector field and describe how this vector field changes (or stays the same) at different points in space.  What do you think the map would look like if you could make it three-dimensional?</p>

			<title>Explanation: Three Charges</title>
			<statement>
			  	<p>Shown below are three point charges (A, B, and C).  Is the magnitude of the net electric force on charge A greater than, less than, or equal to the magnitude of the net electric force on charge C?  Explain your reasoning.</p>
