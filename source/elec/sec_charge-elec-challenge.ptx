You have an electric field generator that can make different electric fields, but when you set it to create a uniform electric field you find that the net force on the wire is 0!

		<title>Three Electric Fields</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A charged wire has one end at <m>x = –L</m> and the other end at <m>x = L</m>.  The wire has a known, non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda(x) = \frac{q_o}{L} \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2L}\right)</m>.  You have an electric field generator that can make the following three electric fields:
				<me>\vec{E}_A = E_o\hat{y}</me>
				<me>\vec{E}_B = E_o\frac{x}{L} \hat{y}</me>
				<me>\vec{E}_C = E_o\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)^2 \hat{y}</me>
				Which electric field will give you the smallest net force on the wire?  Which will give you the largest net force on the wire?  (You may calculate the net forces to check your answer, but your explanation should be qualitative.)
</p>
<p>
As part of your explanation, you should include and use the following:
<ul>
<li>a charge diagram of the wire showing the charge density, using <m>+</m> and <m>-</m> symbols to represent positive and negative charge</li>
<li>an electric field vector map for each electric field</li>
