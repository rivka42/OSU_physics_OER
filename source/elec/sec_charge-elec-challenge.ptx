			<title>The Gecko</title>
			<statement>
				<p>One reason that a gecko (a small lizard with a mass of around <m>75</m> grams) can walk across a ceiling is the electric force.  If we assume the magnitude of the electric field acting on the gecko is <m>10^6 \mathrm{~N/C}</m>, determine the net charge on the gecko's feet.</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
				<p>Numerical sensemaking: explain why, for example, an elephant might have a tough time walking across a ceiling.</p>

			<title>A Charged Spring</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A massless horizontal pring is attached to a support at one end and has a <m> 2.0</m>  <m> \mu C</m> charge glued to the other end. A <m> 4.0</m>  <m> \mu C</m>  charge is slowly brought near. The spring has stretched <m> 1.2 </m>  <m> cm</m> when the charges are <m> 2.6</m>  <m> cm</m> apart. What is the spring constant of the spring?</p>
