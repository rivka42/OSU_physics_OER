        <title>A Piece of Pollen</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>A piece of pollen typically has both a small mass (about <m>5 \mathrm{~ng}</m>) and a small amount of charge (about <m>1 \mathrm{~fC}</m>).  Estimate the electric field that a honeybee needs to create to carry a typical piece of pollen.</p>

		<title>Charged Wires</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A charged wire has one end at <m>x = –L</m> and the other end at <m>x = L</m>.  The wire has a known, non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda(x) = \frac{q_o}{L^2}  x</m>.  You have an electric field generator that can make different electric fields, but when you set it to create a uniform electric field you find that the net force on the wire is 0!  Which of the following alternate settings for your electric field generator would result in a nonzero net force on the wire?
				<me>\vec{E}_1 = - E_o\frac{x}{L}\hat{y}</me>

		    <p>One reason that a gecko (a small lizard with a mass of around <m>75</m> grams) can walk across a ceiling is the electric force.  If we assume the magnitude of the electric field acting on the gecko is <m>10^6 \mathrm{~N/C}</m>, determine the net charge on the gecko’s feet.</p>

		<title>Three Electric Fields</title>
		<statement>
			<p>A charged wire has one end at <m>x = –L</m> and the other end at <m>x = L</m>.  The wire has a known, non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda(x) = \frac{q_o}{L} \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2L}\right)</m>.  You have an electric field generator that can make the following three electric fields:
				<me>\vec{E}_A = E_o\hat{y}</me>
				<me>\vec{E}_B = E_o\frac{x}{L} \hat{y}</me>
				<me>\vec{E}_C = E_o\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)^2 \hat{y}</me>
				Which electric field will give you the smallest net force on the wire?  Which will give you the largest net force on the wire?  (You may calculate the net forces to check your answer, but your explanation should be qualitative.)
</p>
<p>
As part of your explanation, you should include and use the following:
<ul>
<li>a charge diagram of the wire showing the charge density, using <m>+</m> and <m>-</m> symbols to represent positive and negative charge</li>
<li>an electric field vector map for each electric field</li>
</ul>

		<statement>
		    <p>A massless Spring is attached to a support at one end and has a <m> 2.0</m>  <m> \mu C</m> charge glued to the other end. A <m> 4.0</m>  <m> \mu C</m>  charge is slowly brought near.
