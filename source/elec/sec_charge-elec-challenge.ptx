		<statement>
		    <p>A piece of pollen typically has both a small mass (about <m>5 \mathrm{~ng}</m>) and a small amount of charge (about <m>1 \mathrm{~fC}</m>).  Estimate the electric field that a honeybee needs to create to carry a typical piece of pollen.</p>

        <title>The Gecko</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>One reason that a gecko (a small lizard with a mass of around <m>75</m> grams) can walk across a ceiling is the electric force.  If we assume the magnitude of the electric field acting on the gecko is <m>10^6 \mathrm{~N/C}</m>, determine the net charge on the geckoâ€™s feet.</p>

		    <p>A massless Spring is attached to a support at one end and has a <m> 2.0</m>  <m> \mu C</m> charge glued to the other end. A <m> 4.0</m>  <m> \mu C</m>  charge is slowly brought near.

        <title>Charge on a Spring</title>
		<statement>
		    <p>An ideal spring has spring constant <m>k_s</m> (to distinguish it from the electrostatic constant <m>k</m>) and equilibrium length <m>l</m>.  Then, you glue two identical negative point charges to the ends of the spring and observe that the equilibrium length doubles.  Determine the amount of charge on each end of the spring.</p>
