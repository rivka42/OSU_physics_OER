		<title>Equipotential Lines around Conductors</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				 The sketch above shows equipotential lines (which are cross-sections of equipotential surfaces) between two charged conductors (shown in solid black).  Various points on the equipotential lines near the conductors are labeled A, B, C, â€¦, I.  Each question regarding this situation has one correct answer.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Which conductor is positively charged?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						At which of the labeled points does the electric field have the greatest magnitude? 
					</p>

		<title>Zero Electric Potential</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				If the electric potential value at a point in space is zero, does that mean the electric field value at that point must be zero, as well? Explain.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				No.  At each point, the electric field value is proportional to the change in electric potential value (compared to a nearby point).
			</p>

		<title>Voltmeter</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The electric field in a certain region of space is a consistent value of <m>\vec{E} = (-8 \ \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{C})\hat{x}</m>.  Suppose you place the probes of a voltmeter along the x-axis, 2.00 cm apart, in that region.  What is the magnitude of the reading on the voltmeter?

		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				0.16 V

		<title>Electrostatic Equilibrium</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Consider a piece of metal (a conductor) that has come to electrostatic equilibrium in a steady, external electric field. Which of the following statements are true?
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The electric potential everywhere on a conductor is the same value.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The net electric field inside the conductor is zero. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The net electric field outside the conductor is not zero.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The external electric field polarizes the free electrons in the metal, generating an internal electric field that opposes and cancels out the external field.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				(1), (2), (3), (4)
			</p>
		</answer>
