			<title>Capacitor in an Air Conditioner</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					A large capacitor in an air conditioner is typically connected to the potential difference provided to your house (120 V). Although capacitors like this are usually cylindrical, model this one as a parallel plate capacitor with square plates separated by 2.0 mm. If you want your capacitor to store 0.25 J of energy, what is the area of the capacitor plates? How feasible do you think this answer is?

		<title>Zero Electric Potential</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				If the electric potential value at a point in space is zero, does that mean the electric field value at that point must be zero, as well? Explain.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				No.  At each point, the electric field value is proportional to the change in electric potential value (compared to a nearby point).

			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The electric potential everywhere on a conductor is the same value.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The net electric field inside the conductor is zero. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The net electric field outside the conductor is not zero.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The external electric field polarizes the free electrons in the metal, generating an internal electric field that opposes and cancels out the external field.
					</p>
				</li>

		<title>Strength of the Electric Field</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				What is the strength of the electric field in a region where the electric potential is constant?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				The electric field strength is zero because electric potential differences are directly related to the field strength. If the potential difference is zero, then the field strength must also be zero.
