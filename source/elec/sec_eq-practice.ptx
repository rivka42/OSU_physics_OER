		<title>Equipotential Lines around Conductors</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				 The sketch above shows equipotential lines (which are cross-sections of equipotential surfaces) between two charged conductors (shown in solid black).  Various points on the equipotential lines near the conductors are labeled A, B, C, â€¦, I.  Each question regarding this situation has one correct answer.

		<title>Zero Electric Potential</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				If the electric potential value at a point in space is zero, does that mean the electric field value at that point must be zero, as well? Explain.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				No.  At each point, the electric field value is proportional to the change in electric potential value (compared to a nearby point).

		<title>Voltmeter</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The electric field in a certain region of space is a consistent value of <m>\vec{E} = (-8 \ \mathrm{N}/\mathrm{C})\hat{x}</m>.  Suppose you place the probes of a voltmeter along the x-axis, 2.00 cm apart, in that region.  What is the magnitude of the reading on the voltmeter?

				0.16 V

		<title>Electrostatic Equilibrium</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Consider a piece of metal (a conductor) that has come to electrostatic equilibrium in a steady, external electric field. Which of the following statements are true?
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The electric potential everywhere on a conductor is the same value.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The net electric field inside the conductor is zero. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The net electric field outside the conductor is not zero.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The external electric field polarizes the free electrons in the metal, generating an internal electric field that opposes and cancels out the external field.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				(1), (2), (3), (4)
			</p>

		<title>Strength of the Electric Field</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				What is the strength of the electric field in a region where the electric potential is constant?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				The electric field strength is zero because electric potential differences are directly related to the field strength. If the potential difference is zero, then the field strength must also be zero.
			</p>
		</answer>

		<title>Building Hydrogen</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				To form a hydrogen atom, a proton is fixed at a point and an electron is brought from far away to a distance of <m>0.529 \times 10^{-10} \ \mathrm{m}</m>, the average distance between proton and electron in a hydrogen atom. How much work is done?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>

		<title>Equivalence of Units</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Show that units of V/m and N/C for electric field strength are indeed equivalent.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				<m>1 \ \mathrm{V} = 1 \ \frac{J}{C}</m>; <m>1 \ \mathrm{J} = 1 \ \mathrm{Nm} \rightarrow 1 \ \frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{m}} = 1 \ \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{C}}</m>
