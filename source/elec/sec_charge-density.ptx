		<title>Charge Density</title>
		<statement>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p><term>Charge density</term> is the amount of charge in a given amount of space. It can be determined by dividing the small amount of charge <m>dq</m> in portion of an object by the size of that portion of the object.  If the small portion of charge is a one-dimensional line (say, the <m>x</m>-direction), we would call it linear charge density <me>\lambda = \frac{dq}{dx}</me>
		if the charge is on a two-dimensional surface, we would call it surface charge density <me>\sigma = \frac{dq}{dA}</me> where <m> dA</m> represents a small area element
		and if the charge is in a three dimensional volume, we would call it volume charge density <me>\rho = \frac{dq}{dV}</me> where <m> dV</m> represents a small volume element.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>Just like for mass density, charge density describes how charge is distributed throughout a line, a surface, or a volume.</p>

			</p>
			<p>Determine the units for each charge density (one-, two-, or three-dimensional).  Why are they different?</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				The units for one-, two-, and three-dimensional charge density are <m>\mathrm{\frac{C}{m}}</m>, <m>\mathrm{\frac{C}{m^2}}</m>, and <m>\mathrm{\frac{C}{m^3}}</m>, respectively.

			<title>Varying Charge Density</title>

			</p>
			<p>Suppose you have a wire of length <m>L</m> with a charge density that changes from one side to the other. Describe in words why the total charge on your wire is NOT given by <m>q = \lambda L</m>.</p>
