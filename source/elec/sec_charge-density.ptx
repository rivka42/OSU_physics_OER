	<title>Charge Density</title>
	<statement>
		<p><term>Charge density</term> can be found by dividing the small amount of charge <m>dq</m> in a portion of an object by the size of that portion of the object.  If the small portion is one-dimensional, you would call this a linear charge density <m>\lambda = \frac{dq}{dx}</m>; if it is two-dimensional, you would call it <m>\sigma = \frac{dq}{dA}</m>; and if it three dimensional, you would call it <m>\rho = \frac{dq}{dA}</m>.</p>

			  <p>Suppose you have a wire with a charge density that changes from one side to the other. Describe in words why the total charge on your wire is NOT given by <m>q = \lambda L</m>.</p>
