		<title>Charge Density</title>
		<statement>
			<p><term>Charge density</term> can be found by dividing the small amount of charge <m>dq</m> in a portion of an object by the size of that portion of the object.  If the small portion is one-dimensional, you would call it linear charge density <me>\lambda = \frac{dq}{dL}</me>
		if it is two-dimensional, you would call it surface charge density <me>\sigma = \frac{dq}{dA}</me>
		and if it three dimensional, you would call it volume charge density <me>\rho = \frac{dq}{dV}</me></p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>Just like for mass density, we can use the charge density to understand how charge is distributed throughout a line, a surface, or a volume.</p>

			<title>Sensemaking: Charge Density</title>
			<p>Determine the units for each charge density (one-, two-, or three-dimensional).  Why are they different?</p>
		</exercise>	
		<exercise>
			<p>Suppose you have a wire of length <m>L</m> with a charge density that changes from one side to the other. Describe in words why the total charge on your wire is NOT given by <m>q = \lambda L</m>.</p>
