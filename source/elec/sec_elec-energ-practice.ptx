			<title>Moving Charges I</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					Two point charges are fixed in place along the x-axis: <m>-Q_o</m> at <m>x = +L</m> and <m>+4Qo</m> at <m>x = -L</m>. A small positive point charge (<m>+q_i</m>) is initially located at <m>x = 3L</m>, which is the location where the net force is zero. The small positive charge is then given a tiny push either to the right or to the left
				</p>
				<p>
					For each case (tiny push to the right and tiny push to the left), determine the speed of the small positive charge when it has moved a distance <m>L</m> from its initial position.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
				<p>
					Compare your two answers! You may find it useful to sketch a potential energy diagram to help interpret them.

		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				Two identical negative point charges (<m>-Qo</m>) are fixed in place at <m>x = +L</m> and <m>x = -L</m>. A small positive point charge (<m>+q_i</m>) with mass <m>m</m> is at the origin, moving in the negative y-direction with speed <m>v</m>.

			<p>
				What is the farthest distance along the <m>y</m>-axis that the small positive point charge will travel before it turns around?

				Draw a graph of the electric potential energy of this system vs. the <m>y</m>-position of the small positive point charge.

				Evaluate your answer when the initial speed <m>v</m> increases. This one can be tricky—make sure you check that your answer matches what you expect to happen!
