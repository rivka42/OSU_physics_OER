		<title>Electric Potential Comparison</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The electric potential at a location 1 m from a certain charged particle is 4 times the potential at a location 1 m from a different particle. How do the particles' charges compare? (These are two separate trials; assume that only one particle is present for each trial.)
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				The first particle has 4 times the charge of the second particle.

		<title>Closest Approach</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Consider a proton at the origin of a coordinate system, fixed in place (not able to move at all).  Now consider a second proton, free to move, that is launched directly at the first proton at a speed of 42 m/s from a distance very, very far away.  What is the closest the second proton gets to the first proton?
