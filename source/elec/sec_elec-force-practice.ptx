			<title>Three Wires</title>
			<statement>
				<p>Three straight wires (with one end at <m>x = –L</m> and the other end at <m>x = +L</m>) each have the same total charge <m>+Q</m> distributed differently.  Wire A has charge density <m>\lambda_A(x) = +\alpha x^2</m>.  Wire B has charge density <m>\lambda_B(x) = +\beta \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2L}\right)</m>.  Wire C has uniform charge density <m>+\lambda_C</m>.</p>
				<p>You want to predict how the electric fields of these three wires will compare a distance <m>L</m> above the center of each rod (along the <m>y</m>-axis).  Rank the three wires by the magnitude of the electric field produced at this location from smallest to largest.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
				<p>You will need to make a qualitative argument; do not solve for the magnitude of each electric field.</p>

			<title>Trio of Charges</title>

			<title>Charged Wires</title>

				<p>A charged wire has one end at <m>x = -L</m> and the other end at <m>x = L</m>.  The wire has a known, non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda(x) = \frac{q_o}{L^2}  x</m>.  You have an electric field generator that can make different electric fields, but when you set it to create a uniform electric field you find that the net force on the wire is 0!  Which of the following alternate settings for your electric field generator would result in a nonzero net force on the wire?
					<me>\vec{E}_1 = - E_o\frac{x}{L}\hat{y}</me>
					<me>\vec{E}_2 = - E_o\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)^2 \hat{y}</me>

			<title>Three Electric Fields</title>

					<me>\vec{E}_B = E_o\frac{x}{L} \hat{y}</me>
					<me>\vec{E}_C = E_o\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)^2 \hat{y}</me>
					Which electric field will give you the smallest net force on the wire?  Which will give you the largest net force on the wire?  (You may calculate the net forces to check your answer, but your explanation should be qualitative.)

				As part of your explanation, you should include and use the following:

				<li>an electric field vector map for each electric field</li>
