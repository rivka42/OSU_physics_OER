			<p>Three straight wires (with one end at <m>x = â€“L</m> and the other end at <m>x = +L</m>) each have the same total charge <m>+Q</m> distributed differently.  Wire A has charge density <m>\lambda_A(x) = +\alpha x^2</m>.  Wire B has charge density <m>\lambda_B(x) = +\beta \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2L}\right)</m>.  Wire C has uniform charge density <m>+\lambda_C</m>.</p>
			<p>You want to predict how the electric fields of these three wires will compare a distance <m>L</m> above the center of each rod (along the <m>y</m>-axis).  Rank the three wires by the magnitude of the electric field produced at this location from smallest to largest.
