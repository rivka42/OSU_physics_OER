		<title>Charges and Arcs</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
			Shown below are three different situations.  In case A, both point charges are negative.  In case B, the left point charge is positive and the right point charge is negative.  In case C, the negative charge is uniformly distributed across the circular arc.  Rank the three situations by the magnitude of the electric field at point P.  (Focus on A vs. B and A vs. C: treat B vs. C as a challenge problem only!)
