  <p>
		If you know the electric field of a given charge distribution, you can integrate the electric field along a path to determine the electric potential difference between two points. Notice that the electric potential difference is a scalar quantity.

		<title>Determining Electric Potential Difference from Electric Field</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>The <term>electric potential difference</term> can be calculated using the equation <me>\Delta V = - \int_{r_i}^{r_f} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}</me>. </p>
		</statement>

		<title>Cartesian <m>\vec{dr}</m></title>
		
		
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				In the equation for <m>\Delta V</m> above, the quantity <m>\vec{dr}</m> represents an infinitesimally small step along a path from <m>r_i</m> to <m>r_f</m>.  In Cartesian coordinates, such a step may be represented as:
				<me>
					\vec{dr} = dx\hat{x} + dy\hat{y} + dz\hat{z}
				</me>
				
				Given this definition, <m>\vec{dr}</m> will not be the same for different paths, and you will typically need to use your knowledge of the specific path to simplify <m>\vec{dr}.</m>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<title>Shortcuts for <m>\vec{dr}</m></title>

			<p>
				  The simplest paths can be described as along a single direction: for example, if the path is only in the <m>y</m>-direction, <m>\vec{dr} = dy \hat{y}</m>, while if the path is only in the <m>z</m>-direction then <m>\vec{dr} = dz \hat{z}</m>.

	<note>
		<title>Path Independence</title>
		<p>
			The electric field is an example of a conservative vector field.  One consequence of this is that the line integral for finding <m>\Delta V</m> is <term>path independent</term>.  Since the value of the line integral does not depend on the path, you can always choose the path that makes evaluating the integral as easy as possible.

			<p>If you know the electric field and you want to determine the electric potential difference, you can use the above equation. There is a negative sign in front of the integral in the above equation. What do you think this negative sign means physically?</p>
