			</p>
			<p>The <term>electric potential difference</term> can be calculated using the equation <me>\Delta V = - \int_{r_i}^{r_f} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}</me>. </p>
		</statement>
	</principle>

	<p>
		If you know the electric field of a given charge distribution, you can integrate the electric field along a path to determine the electric potential difference between two points. Notice that the electric potential difference is a scalar quantity.

			<p>If you know the electric field and you want to determine the electric potential difference, you can use the above equation. There is a negative sign in front of the integral in the above equation. What do you think this negative sign means physically?</p>
