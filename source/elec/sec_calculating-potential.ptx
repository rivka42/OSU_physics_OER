		<title>Warm-Up Activity</title>
		<exercise>
			<p>A few weeks ago, you found the electric field at the center of a uniformly charged semicircle with total charge <m>Q</m> and radius <m>R</m>. How do you think you would find the electric potential at the center of this semicircle?</p>

	<p>To determine the electric potential due to some charge distribution, we will use our <alert>Chop-Multiply-Add method!</alert></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><term>Chop</term> up the charged object into tiny pieces and find <m>dq</m> on each piece.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><term>Multiply</term> <m>dq</m> and other quantities to find <m>dV</m> due to that part of the charge.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><term>Add</term> together all the <m>dV</m>'s using an integral to get the net electric potential.</p>
		</li>

			<p>Let's go back to the uniformly charged semicircle with total charge <m>Q</m> and radius <m>R</m>. Using the Chop-Multiply-Add method, set up an integral to determine the electric potential.</p>
