		<title>Moving Charges I</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Two point charges are fixed in place along the x-axis: <m>-Q_o</m> at <m>x = +L</m> and <m>+4Qo</m> at <m>x = -L</m>. A small positive point charge (<m>+q_i</m>) is initially located at <m>x = 3L</m>, which is the location where the net force is zero. The small positive charge is then given a tiny push either to the right or to the left
			</p>
			<p>
				For each case (tiny push to the right and tiny push to the left), determine the speed of the small positive charge when it has moved a distance <m>L</m> from its initial position.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Compare your two answers! You may find it useful to sketch a potential energy diagram to help interpret them.

		<title>Electric Potential of a Wire I</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The wire shown above has its middle located at the origin. The wire has length <m>L</m> and a non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda = \frac{q_o y}{L^2}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each of the two labeled points (A and B), is the electric potential positive, negative, or zero?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Sketch a charge diagram of the wire.

		<title>Electric Potential of a Wire II</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Write an expression for the electric potential at point A and point B for the wire above.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</project>

	<project>
		<title>Moving Charges II</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Two identical negative point charges (<m>-Qo</m>) are fixed in place at <m>x = +L</m> and <m>x = -L</m>. A small positive point charge (<m>+q_i</m>) with mass <m>m</m> is at the origin, moving in the negative y-direction with speed <m>v</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is the farthest distance along the <m>y</m>-axis that the small positive point charge will travel before it turns around?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Draw a graph of the electric potential energy of this system vs. the <m>y</m>-position of the small positive point charge.
			</p>
		</hint>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Evaluate your answer when the initial speed <m>v</m> increases. This one can be trickyâ€”make sure you check that your answer matches what you expect to happen!

		<title>Electric Potential of a Wire III</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The wire shown above has one end located at the origin. The wire has length <m>L</m> and a non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda = \frac{q_o y}{L^2}</m>. Points A and B are located a distance <m>x_o</m> from the top and bottom ends of the wire, respectively.

			<p>
				Is the electric potential at point A greater than, less than, or equal to the electric potential at point B?

		<statement>
			<p>
				A uniformly charged ring with total charge <m>-q_o</m> and radius <m>R</m> is located in the <m>xy</m>-plane. Determine the electric potential a distance <m>z</m> above the center of the ring
