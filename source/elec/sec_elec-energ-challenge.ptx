		<title>Electric Potential of a Wire</title>
		<statement>
			<figure xml:id="fig_charged-wire-2">
				<caption>A charged wire lies along the y-axis with one end starting at the origin.</caption>
				<image source="elec/charged-wire-2.png" width = "35%" ></image>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The wire shown above has one end located at the origin. The wire has length <m>L</m> and a non-uniform charge density <m>\lambda = \frac{q_o y}{L^2}</m>. Points A and B are located a distance <m>x_o</m> from the top and bottom ends of the wire, respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Is the electric potential at point A greater than, less than, or equal to the electric potential at point B?
