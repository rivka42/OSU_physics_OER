		<title>Capacitor in an Air Conditioner</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A large capacitor in an air conditioner is typically connected to the potential difference provided to your house (120 V). Although capacitors like this are usually cylindrical, model this one as a parallel plate capacitor with square plates separated by 2.0 mm. If you want your capacitor to store 0.25 J of energy, what is the area of the capacitor plates? How feasible do you think this answer is?

		<title>Infinite Wires</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Two infinite wires are located parallel to the y-axis. One wire has uniform charge density <m>+\lambda</m> and is located at <m>x = +x_o</m>. The other wire has uniform charge density <m>-\lambda</m> and is located at <m>x = -x_o</m>. The electric potential in the <m>xy</m>-plane for this system is given by: <me>
					V(x, y) = 2k \lambda \ln{|x + x_o |} - 2k \lambda \ln{|x-x_o |} = 2k \lambda \ln{| \frac{x + x_o }{x - x_o} |}
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				Complete the following tasks as part of your ARCS solution:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Physical representation: Create an accurate equipotential graph in the <m>xy</m>-plane and the corresponding electric field vector map.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Calculate: Find the electric field at every point in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Sensemaking: Show that your electric field is what you expect from the superposition of two infinite line charges.
						</p>
					</li>
