	<title>Charging Revisited</title>
		
 	
<p>
As you saw in the previous section, different materials interact with charges differently. You may already know that metals are better at conducting electricity than wood or plastic. However, what you might not know is how the electronic structure of a material affects its ability to be charged and how charges behave on or within that material. What does it mean to conduct electricity and how does the atomic structure of materials lead to different charge properties? We will explore these ideas together in this section.

<p>
In solids, electron energy levels broaden into bands due to interactions with neighboring atoms. In a solid, the discrete energy levels of individual atoms merge into continuous bands due to the large number of atoms in a solid and the electric interactions between atoms. The <alert> valence band</alert> is the highest energy band that is completely filled with electrons. It's similar to the outermost electron orbital of an atom that is filled with electrons. The charge carriers in metals are electrons that are free to migrate in the energy band called the <alert> conduction band </alert>. The conduction band is far enough away from the positive nuclei that electrons in the conduction band can flow freely from nucleus to nucleus in the material. The <alert> band gap </alert> is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The valence and conduction bands are separated by energy gaps, or positions where electrons are forbidden to exist. </p>

<p>
In <em> conductors </em>, the valence band overlaps with the conduction band, allowing electrons to move freely and conduct electricity easily. In <em> insulators </em>, the band gap between the valence and conduction bands is very large, making it difficult for electrons to move from one band to the other. This results in charges that are immobile and materials with low electrical conductivity. In semiconductors, the band gap is relatively small, allowing some electrons to move from the valence band to the conduction band under certain conditions. This gives semiconductors intermediate conductivity between conductors and insulators. Band theory is only an approximation to the quantum state of a solid. Understanding the electrical properties of different materials is still an active field of research and study called <em> materials science</em>. Many modern companies (semi-conductor industry, solar industry, battery industry, etc., ...) are interested in hiring scientists to perform <em> materials science research </em> to understand the electric properties of materials.
