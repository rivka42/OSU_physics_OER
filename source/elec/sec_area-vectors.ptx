			<p>You want to find the dot product between two vectors, <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>.  What do you know about the directions of vectors if the dot product is positive?  What if the dot product is negative?  What if the dot product is zero?</p>

		<title>Area Vector</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>area vector</term> <m>\vec{A}</m> for a surface points <em>perpendicular</em> to the surface, with a magnitude equal to the area of the surface.  For an infinitesimal surface, the area vector is typically written <m>d\vec{A}</m>. An area vectors has units of <m>\mathrm{m}^2</m></p>

      <title>Differential Area Vectors</title>
      <p></p>
			<p>Write a differential area vector <m>d\vec{A}</m> for a small part of the front cover of the book in terms of differential elements like <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m>.  Check that your expression has the correct units!</p>
