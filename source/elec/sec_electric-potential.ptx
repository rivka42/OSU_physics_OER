		<title>Electric Potential Difference</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>electric potential difference </term> is written as <m>\Delta V</m> and has units of <m>\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{C}</m> or Volts (<m>V</m>). It is also sometimes called the voltage.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>For a single point charge, the electric potential difference can be written as <me>V = k \frac{q}{r}</me>.</p>
