                <title>Practice: Corner Reflector</title>
                <p>
                    A corner reflector is made up of two mirrors meeting each other at a 90 degree angle. Let a light ray hit one of the mirrors so that the ray is reflected to the other mirror. Draw a ray diagram of this situation. What do you notice about the final reflected ray? What is special about this kind of object?
