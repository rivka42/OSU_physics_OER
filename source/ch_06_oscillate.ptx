  <title>Oscillations</title>
	<introduction>
    <p> Oscillations are ubiquitous in the natural world. The swaying of a tree in the wind, the motion of a child playing on a swing, springs, pendulums, musical instruments and even atoms bonded together in modules all undergo oscillatory motion. Additionally, as we will later see, oscillations are the source of waves. Our physical models of oscillatory motion will carry over to the next chapter where we study wave motion. In this chapter you will focus on applying physics models to oscillations and oscillatory motion.</p>
