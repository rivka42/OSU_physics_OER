  <title>Small-Angle Approximation</title>
			
<p>
The <alert>small-angle approximation</alert> is used to approximate the values of the main trigonometric functions when the angles involved are restricted to a certain domain. In practice, angles that are small are angles where <m> \theta \ll 1.0</m> radian. 

Any function can be expanded into an infinite sum of polynomials. This is called a series expansion. Consider a series expansion (Taylor Series) of the sine and cosine functions:

<me> \sin(\theta) = \sum^\infty_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1}\theta^{2n+1} = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!} -\frac{\theta^7}{7!}-....</me>

<me> \cos(\theta) = \sum^\infty_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n}\theta^{2n} = 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2!}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!} -\frac{\theta^6}{6!}-....</me>

The small-angle approximation considers only the first term in the sum. 

<men> \sin(\theta) \approx \theta</men>
<men> \cos(\theta) \approx 1</men>

In figure <xref ref="small-angle"></xref> we show a graphical representation the small-angle approximation for the <m> \sin(\theta)</m> function in action. We can see the linear function <m> \theta</m> and the trigonometric function <m> \sin(\theta)</m> closely match each other when the angle is small. </p>

  <p>  
We should always take time to think about and determine the error associated with introducing approximations in our calculations.

		<title>Analyzing the Equation of Motion</title>
		<statement>
		<p>Looking at equation <xref ref="pendulumE2"></xref> apply the small angle approximation to determine an equation of motion. The determine the oscillation frequency of the simple pendulum. </p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
		<p> Applying the small-angle approximation we find that <m> \sin\theta \approx \theta</m> and our equation of motion becomes,
		
		<men> \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\theta(t)=-\frac{g}{L} \theta(t)</men>
from this and our model of simple harmonic motion, we can directly see that the oscillation frequency is
		
		<men> \omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}</men>.
