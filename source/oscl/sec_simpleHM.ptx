  <title>Simple Harmonic Motion</title>
			
    <p>
<alert>Oscillatory motion</alert> is a repetitive back and forth motion that regularly repeats in time. Oscillatory motion occurs when an object is displaced away from its natural resting position and forces are present which act to push the object back to its resting position. This natural resting position is called the object's <alert>equilibrium position</alert>.  
</p>

<p>
The forces which lead to oscillatory motion are called <alert>restoring forces</alert>. Recall that an object is said to be in <em>equilibrium</em> when there are no net forces acting on the object. A restoring force is a type of force which arises when the object is displaced away from equilibrium and it always acts against the object's displacement to bring the system back to equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
<alert>Simple harmonic motion</alert> is one of the most common and fundamental motions in science and engineering and is the basis for understanding all oscillatory motion. Simple harmonic motion is motion where the position (and velocity) of the object can be represented by a sinusoidal function. 
</p>

<p> 
<men xml:id="pos_HM">\vec{x}(t) = A \cos(\frac{2\pi t}{T})\hat{x}</men>
</p>

<p>
Here, the notation <m> x(t)</m> reminds us that the position <m>x</m> of the object in simple harmonic motion is a <em>function</em> of time t. The position graph is a cosine function with an <alert>amplitude</alert> A and a <alert>period</alert> T. For this oscillation, the object has an equilibrium position at <m> x = 0 </m>. The amplitude represents the maximal distance away from the equilibrium position. Notice that the object oscillates between <m> x = A </m> and <m> x = -A </m>. The period represents the time it takes in seconds to complete one full oscillation. </p>


<p>
Another important characteristic of oscillatory motion is the <alert>frequency</alert>, <em>f</em>. The frequency is the number of cycles that occur in one second. Since period T represents the time it takes to complete one cycle, period and frequency have an inverse relationship. 
</p>

<me> f = \frac{1}{T}</me>

<p>
Recall that a particle in uniform circular motion has an angular velocity <m>\omega</m> that is related to the period of motion by <m>\omega= \frac{2 \pi}{T}</m>. The physical units of <m>\omega</m> given in <m>rad/s</m>. Most of the symbolic work we will do when representing oscillations in problems and equations will be done in terms of the angular frequency.
