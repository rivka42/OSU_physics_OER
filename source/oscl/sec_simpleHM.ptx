  <title>Simple Harmonic Motion</title>
			
<p>
The next situation to which you will apply and adapt your physics model is <alert>oscillatory motion</alert>: any back-and-forth motion that regularly repeats in time.

	<p>Make a list of everyday examples of oscillatory motion you have experienced.  What commonalities do you notice between them?  How common do you think oscillatory motion is in the real world?</p>

<p>
Oscillatory motion occurs when an object is displaced away from a <alert>stable equilibrium</alert> such that a net force acts to return the object to this resting position.  The forces that lead to oscillatory motion are typically called <alert>restoring forces</alert>. <!--Recall that an object is said to be in <em>equilibrium</em> when there are no net forces acting on the object. --> A restoring force always acts against an object's displacement from equilibrium to bring the system back to that equilibrium.  <xref ref="def_spring" text="title"/>, in which the force is directly proportional to displacement, is the canonical example restoring force. </p>

<p>
Often, oscillatory motion can be represented by a position that is a sinusoidal function of time.  This most fundamental oscillatory motion, <em>simple harmonic motion</em>, can be described by a sine or cosine function.  More complicated oscillatory motion can be described either as a sum of sinusoidal functions or as a sinusoidal function multiplied by other functions such as exponential functions.

<men xml:id="restore_force">\vec{F}(x) = -k\Delta x \hat{x}</men>
where <m> \Delta x = x-x_0</m> and <m>x_0</m> is the equilibrium position. The negative sign reminds us that the force is always in the opposite direction as the displacement. An interesting aspect of these type forces is that they are position dependent forces. The notation <m>F(x)</m> reminds us that the force <m>F</m> is a function of position <m>x</m>. 
</p>

<p>
Position dependent forces in physics generally have associated potential energy functions. We will explore this aspect of these forces in more detail in a later section of this chapter where we discuss energy in simple harmonic motion. </p>
