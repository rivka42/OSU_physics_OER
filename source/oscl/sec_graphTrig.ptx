Simple harmonic motion is motion where the position as a function of time of the object undergoing oscillatory motion can be represented by a sinusoidal function. 
</p>

<p> 
<men xml:id="pos_HM">\vec{x}(t) = A \cos(\frac{2\pi t}{T} + \phi_0)\hat{x}</men>
</p>

<p>
Here, the notation <m> x(t)</m> reminds us that the position <m>x</m> of the object is a <em>function</em> of time <m>t</m>. The position graph is a cosine function with an <alert>amplitude</alert> <m>A</m>, a <alert>period</alert> <m>T</m> and a <alert>phase constant</alert> <m> \phi_0</m>. The argument of a trigonometric function is called the <em>phase</em> and the phase constant <m> \phi_0</m> tells us the initial conditions for the oscillation, when <m> t=0</m>.

<p>
Looking at figure <xref ref="HM_position"></xref> see a graph of position as a function of time. For this oscillation, the object has an equilibrium position at <m> x = 0 </m>. The amplitude represents the maximal distance away from the equilibrium position. Notice that the object oscillates between <m> x = A </m> and <m> x = -A </m>. The period represents the time it takes in seconds to complete one full oscillation. 
</p>


<p>
Another important characteristic of oscillatory motion is the <alert>frequency</alert>, <em>f</em>. The frequency is the number of cycles that occur in one second. Since period T represents the time it takes to complete one cycle, period and frequency have an inverse relationship.

<p>
Recall that a particle in uniform circular motion has an angular velocity <m>\omega</m> that is related to the period of motion by <m>\omega= \frac{2 \pi}{T}</m>. The physical units of <m>\omega</m> given in <m>rad/s</m>. Most of the symbolic work we will do when representing oscillations in problems and equations will be done in terms of the angular frequency, <m>\omega</m>.

		<title>Physical Units</title>
		<statement>
		<p>Looking at equation <xref ref="pos_HM"></xref> what are the physical dimension and SI units of amplitude and period? How can you tell?</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
		<p>The equation as a whole is a position and has dimension of length with SI units of meters. Trigonometric functions are dimensionless. Therefore, the amplitude must have dimension of length for the equation to be true. The SI units of amplitude are meters. The argument of a trigonometric function must also be dimensionless with SI units of radians. Therefore, the fraction <m>\frac{2\pi t}{T}</m> must be dimensionless. The only way for this to be true is if the dimension of period is time. The SI units of time are the second. </p>

		<title>Exploring the Period, Frequency and Angular Frequency</title>
		<statement>
		<p>It is often useful to be able to represent oscillatory motion in terms of the period T, the frequency <em>f</em> or the angular frequency <m>\omega</m>. Write the relationship between angular frequency <m>\omega</m>, period and frequency. </p>
		</statement>
		<answer> 
		<p>We can write a relation between period <m>T</m>, frequency <m>f</m>, and angular frequency <m>\omega</m> as follows:</p>
		
		<men> \omega = 2 \pi f = \frac{2 \pi}{T} </men>

		<title>Exploring the Position Function</title>
		<statement>
		<p>It is often useful to be able to represent the position function in terms of the period T, the frequency <em>f</em> or the angular frequency <m>\omega</m>. Rewrite equation <xref ref="pos_HM"></xref> in terms of the frequency <m>f</m> or the angular frequency <m>\omega</m></p>
		</statement>
		</exercise>
		<answer>
		<p>We can write the position relationship as follows:</p>
		
		<men> \vec{x}(t) = A \cos(\frac{2\pi t}{T} + \phi_0)\hat{x}= A \cos(2 \pi f t+ \phi_0)\hat{x}=A \cos(\omega t+ \phi_0)\hat{x} </men>
		<p>often <m>\vec{x}(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi_0)\hat{x}</m> is most useful for solving problems. This is the form of the equation we will use going forward. </p>
