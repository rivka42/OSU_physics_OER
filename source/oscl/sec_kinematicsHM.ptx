  <title>Kinematics Relations of Oscillatory Motion</title>
			
<p>
We can use differential calculus to find kinematic relationships for an object undergoing ocillatory motion. The time derivative of position yields the velocity of the system. 

<men> \frac{d}{dt} \vec{x}(t) = \vec{v}(t)</men>
</p>
<p>
Taking the time derivative of equation <xref ref="pos_HM"></xref>. yields the velocity function <m> \vec{v}(t)</m>
</p>


<p> 
<men xml:id="vel_HM"> \vec{v}(t) = - \omega A \sin(\omega t + \phi_0)\hat{x} </men>
</p>

<p>
As the object passes through the equilibrium position located at <m> x = 0 </m>, the speed (magnitude of the velocity) is maximum. When the object is maximally displaced from equilibrium, it temporarily comes to rest before changing its direction. Recall that a maxima or minima in the position as a function of time graph corresponds to a <alert> turning point</alert> in the motion. Therefore, when the object is located at <m> x= \pm A</m> the instantaneous velocity of the object is zero.

		<statement>
		<p>Looking at equation <xref ref="vel_HM"></xref> what are the physical dimension and SI units of the quantity <m> \omega A</m>? What is the physical significance of this quantity?</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
		<p>The equation as a whole is a velocity and has dimension of length/time with SI units of meters/second. Trigonometric functions are dimensionless. Therefore, the quantity <m> \omega A</m> must have dimension of length/time for the equation to be true. The physical significance of this quantity is that it corresponds to the maximum speed <m> v_{max} = \omega A </m> of the object. This allows us to re-write equation <xref ref="HM_velocity"></xref> as follows</p>
		
		
	<p>
	<men> \vec{v}(t) = - v_{max} \sin(\omega t + \phi_0) \hat{x} </men>
