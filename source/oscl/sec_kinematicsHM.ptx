  <title>Equations of Motion</title>
		<p>
			In studying oscillations, you will frequently work with the <alert>equations of motion</alert>: equations for position <m>\vec{x}(t)</m>, velocity <m>\vec{v}(t)</m>, and acceleration <m>\vec{a}(t)</m> as functions of time.  The derivative relationship between these three quantities allows you to calculate all of them if you know one of them.

			<title>Exploring Velocity</title>
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Starting from the general one-dimensional position function for simple harmonic motion <me>x(t) = x_o + x_{\text{max}} \cos{(\omega t + \phi_o)}</me> take the derivative to find the velocity function <m>\vec{v}(t)</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p> <men xml:id="vel_HM"> v(t) = - \omega x_{\text{max}} \sin(\omega t + \phi_o) </men></p>
				</solution>
			</task>
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Graph both the position and the velocity functions.  Choose one or two instants in time and check that the two graphs agree with each other.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
As the object passes through the equilibrium position located at <m> \vec{x} = 0 </m>, the speed (magnitude of the velocity) is maximum. When the object is maximally displaced from equilibrium, it temporarily comes to rest before changing its direction. Recall that a maxima or minima in the position as a function of time graph corresponds to a <alert> turning point</alert> in the motion. Therefore, when the object is located at <m> x= \pm A</m> the instantaneous velocity of the object is zero.

		<statement>
		<p>What are the SI units of the quantity <m> \omega x_{\text{max}}</m>? What is the physical significance of this quantity?</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>The equation as a whole is a velocity and has dimension of length/time with SI units of meters/second. Trigonometric functions are dimensionless. Therefore, the quantity <m> \omega A</m> must have dimension of length/time for the equation to be true. Note that the SI units of <m> \omega</m> are <m> rad/s</m>. While radians are an SI unit, they are dimensionless. The physical significance of this quantity is that it corresponds to the maximum speed <m> v_{max} = \omega x_{\text{max}} </m> of the object. This allows you to re-write equation the velocity equation of motion as:</p>
	<p>
	<men> \vec{v}(t) = - v_{max} \sin(\omega t + \phi_0) \hat{x} </men>

		<statement>
		<p>Derive the acceleration of an object in simple harmonic motion using the methods discussed in this section. </p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>Looking at equation <xref ref="HM_velocity" text='type-global'></xref>, take the time derivative of velocity to determine the acceleration of the system.</p>
			
	<p>
	<men> \vec{a}(t) = - \omega^2 x_{\text{max}} \cos(\omega t + \phi_0) \hat{x} </men>
	
	Note that the quantity <m> \omega^2 A = a_{max}</m> represents the magnitude of the acceleration of the object when <m> \vec{x}= \pm x_{\text{max}} \hat{x}</m>.
