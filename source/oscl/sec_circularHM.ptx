  <title>Relationship to Circular Motion</title>
			
<p>
Consider a particle in uniform circular motion with angular velocity <m> \omega </m>. The x-component of the particle's position when the particle has angular position <m> \phi</m> and radius <m> r=A </m> can be written using trigonometric relations as

<me> x = A\cos(\phi) </me>

We will now show that this is equivalent to the position function <m> x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi_0) </m> for an oscillation where the particle has initial conditions <m> \phi_0 = 0 </m>  at <m> t=0 </m>. Recall the angular velocity is the rate of change of angular position

<me> \phi = \frac{d\theta}{dt} </me> 

This equation is separable. A small change in angle can be written, 

<me> d\phi = \omega dt </me>

If the particle is in uniform circular motion, then <m> \omega </m> is constant in time. Integrating both sides of the relationship

<me> \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi} d \phi = \omega \int_{0}^{t} dt \rightarrow \phi = \omega t +\phi_0 </me>

As time increases, the particle's x-component can be written as

<me> x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi_0) </me>

We see that as the particle moves in a circle, it's projection onto the x-axis oscillates between <m> x = \pm A </m>. Thus, <alert> uniform circular motion is simple harmonic motion when projected onto one spatial axis </alert>.

<p>
This also helps us understand the meaning of the <alert> phase constant </alert>. The <alert> phase </alert> of the motion is determined by the quantity <m> \phi = \omega t +\phi_0</m> and represents the angle of the particle in circular motion. The phase constant <m> \phi_0 </m>  is the initial angle when <m> t = 0 </m>. Setting <m> t = 0 </m> in our position function for a simple harmonic oscillator, we can find the initial x-position

<me> x_0 = A \cos(\phi_0) </me> 

Thus different values of the phase constant represent different starting points on the circle and correspond to different <em> initial conditions </em> of the motion.
