  <title>Relationship to Circular Motion</title>
			
<p>
Consider a particle in uniform circular motion with angular velocity <m> \omega(t) </m>. The <m>x</m>-component of the particle's position when the particle has angular position <m> \theta(t)</m> and radius <m> r=A </m> can be written using trigonometric relations as

<me> x = A\cos(\phi) </me>

This is equivalent to the position function <m> x(t) = A \cos(\omega_s t + \phi_o) </m> for an oscillating block on a spring with initial condition <m> \phi_o = 0 </m>  at <m> t=0 </m>. Recall the angular velocity is the rate of change of angular position

<me> \omega(t) = \frac{d\theta}{dt} </me> 

This equation is separable. A small change in angle can be written, 

<me> d\theta = \omega(t) dt </me>

If the particle is in uniform circular motion, then <m> \omega(t) = \omega </m> is constant in time. Integrating both sides of the relationship

<me> \int_{\theta_o}^{\theta} d \theta = \omega \int_{0}^{t} dt \rightarrow \theta(t) = \omega t + \theta_o </me>

As time increases, the particle's <m>x</m>-component can be written as

<me> x(t) = A \cos(\theta(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \theta_o) </me>

As the particle moves in a circle, its projection onto the <m>x</m>-axis oscillates between <m> x = \pm A </m>. Thus, <alert> uniform circular motion is simple harmonic motion when projected onto one spatial axis </alert>.

<p>
This can also help you understand the meaning of the <alert> initial phase </alert>. The <alert> phase </alert> in oscillatory motion is given by <m> \phi = \omega_s t +\phi_o</m> and is analogous to the angle of a particle in circular motion <m> \theta = \omega t +\theta_o</m>. The initial phase <m>\phi_o </m> in oscillatory motion is analogous to the initial angle <m>\theta_o</m> when <m> t = 0 </m>. Setting <m> t = 0 </m> in the position function for a simple harmonic oscillator, you can find the initial <m>x</m>-position

<me> x_0 = A \cos(\theta_o) </me> 

Thus different values of the phase constant represent different starting points on the circle and correspond to different <em> initial conditions </em> of the motion.
