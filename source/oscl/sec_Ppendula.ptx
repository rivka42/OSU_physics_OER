  <title>The Rigid-Body Pendulum</title>
			
<p>
A pendulum does not need to be a simple mass on a string. In fact, many objects that can be modeled in the rigid-body model can act as pendulums. For example, as you walk, your leg swings like a pendulum. Consider a pendulum made from a rigid-body object. </p>

We will use a torque analysis and our model of simple harmonic motion to analyze the system.  We apply the general physics problem-solving strategy to analyze the motion. The gravitational torque is 

 <me> \tau = -LMg\sin\theta(t) = I \alpha</me> 
 
Recall that the gravitational force acts at the center of mass of a rigid-body. Here, we have labeled the distance from the pivot to the center of mass <m>L</m>. We apply the small-angle approximation, 

<me> \sin\theta(t) \approx \theta(t)</me>

Note that our analysis will only provide an accurate predictive model when the angle <m> \theta(t)</m> is small. From this we can determine the equation of motion for the system

<men xml:id="PpendulumE"> \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\theta(t)=-\frac{MgL}{I} \theta(t)</men>

The equation of motion is in the form of equation <xref ref="HM_model"></xref> and so we can directly determine the oscillation frequency and period of the system.

 <men xml:id="PpendulumE2"> \omega=\sqrt{\frac{MgL}{I}}= \frac{2 \pi}{T}</men>
 
This equation is general for any rigid-body object so long as we specify the moment of inertia and properly determine the distance from the pivot to the center of mass.
