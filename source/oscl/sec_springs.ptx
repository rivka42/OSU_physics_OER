  <title>Oscillatory Motion of Spring Systems</title>
			
 <p>
Let's apply what we have learned to analyze the oscillatory motion of a mass on a spring. Consider a spring with spring constant <m>k</m> that has one end held fixed in space and one end attached to a block of mass <m>m</m>which rests on a frictionless surface. We will assume the spring has negligible mass compared to the object's mass <m>m</m> such that we can apply the massless spring approximation to our analysis. 
</p>

<p>
The spring has an equilibrium length <m> L_0</m> and is initially stretched and then released. We know from experience that the spring will undergo oscillatory motion. We would like to determine an equation of motion for the mass on the spring, the period and oscillation frequency for the spring. 
</p>

<p>
We apply the general physics problem-solving strategy to analyze the motion. First we draw a picture of the situation, and choose a coordinate system we will use to reference positions and velocities of the mass.

The spring force is a restoring force given by Hooke's law:

<men> \vec{F}(x) = -k(x-L_0) \hat{x}</men>

The negative sign tells us that the force always points in the opposite direction as the displacement. If we place the origin of our coordinate system at equilibrium, then Hooke's law is simplified to 

<men> \vec{F}(x) = -kx \hat{x}</men>

Applying Newton's law to the system and setting the force equal to the spring force

<men xml:id="Hookes"> ma_x = -kx </men>

Using the relationship between position, and acceleration where acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time, 
 
<men> a_x(t) = \frac{d}{dt} v_x(t) = \frac{d^2}{dt^2}x(t) </men>

we can re-write equation <xref ref="Hookes"></xref> in terms of position only

<men xml:id="EOM"> \frac{d^2}{dt^2}x(t) = -\frac{k}{m} x(t)</men>

Equation <xref ref="EOM"></xref> is called the <alert>equation of motion</alert> for the mass on the spring. This is a second order differential equation. Unlike algebraic functions whose solutions are numbers, solutions of differential equation are <em>functions</em>. This differential equation is one in which taking two derivatives of the function <m>x(t)</m>  yields the original function multiplied by a negative constant. 
</p>

<p>
Often we can guess the solutions to differential equations. Since we already know the motion will be oscillatory from everyday experience, the natural guess for this physical situation is a position function that is oscillatory in time. Consider the position function

<men> x(t) = A \cos{\omega t + \phi_0}</men>

Taking two derivatives in time

<men> \frac{d^2}{dt^2}x(t) = - \omega^2 A \cos{\omega t + \phi_0}</men>

Plugging all this back into the equation of motion yields

<men> - \omega^2 A \cos{\omega t + \phi_0} = -\frac{k}{m} A \cos{\omega t + \phi_0}</men>

From this we can determine the oscillation frequency of the spring system. 

<men> \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},</men>

		2. If you increase the stiffness of the spring how does this affect the frequency of oscillation?
		3. If we took the mass on a spring to another planet where the accleration due to gravity at the surface of the planet was larger than on Earth, how would this affect the frequency of oscillation</p>
