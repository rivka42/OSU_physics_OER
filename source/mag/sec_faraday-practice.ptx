					The switch in the circuit above has been closed for a very long time. At the instant you flip the switch to the right, what is the current through the inductor? At the same instant, what is the absolute value of the voltage across the inductor?

			<title>Square Loop in a Magnetic Field</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					A square loop of wire with side length 6 cm and resistance 0.4 <m>\Omega</m> is in a uniform magnetic field <m>B = -0.008t^2</m> (in Tesla) that points in the <m>z</m>-direction (through the loop). Determine the current induced in the loop as a function of time (both magnitude and direction).

			<title>Induced Current</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					A single conducting loop of wire has an area of <m>7.40 \times 10^{-2} \ \mathrm{m}^2</m> and a resistance of 110 <m>\Omega</m>. Perpendicular to the plane of the loop is a magnetic field of strength 0.280 T. At what rate (in T/s) must this field change if the induced current in the loop is to be 0.32 A?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					476 T/s

			<title>Conductive Loop in a Magnetic Field</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					A conductive metal loop is at rest within a uniform magnetic field, as shown above. If the magnetic field strength is then decreased, in which direction does induced current flow in the loop?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					There is no current.

			<title>Falling Loop</title>
			<statement><p></p>
				<p>
					The figure shows a circular conductive loop falling away from a long wire that is carrying current to the right, as shown above. What is the direction of the induced current in the loop?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					Clockwise.
