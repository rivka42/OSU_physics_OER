		<title>Solenoid</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				Consider the magnetic field created by an infinitely long solenoid with radius <m>R</m> and <m>n</m> coils per unit length carrying a steady clockwise current <m>I</m>. Starting from the assumption that the magnetic field everywhere in space must point in either the positive or negative <m>z</m>-direction (parallel to the axis of the solenoid), use Ampere's Law to determine the magnitude and direction of this magnetic field.

		<hint>
			<p>
				You will need to choose Amperian Loops thoughtfully, and you may need more than one!

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				Write a short paragraph discussing how a changing magnetic field can result in an induced current. As part of your description, highlight specific activities you completed this week.
