		<title>Semi-Circular Wire</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field strength at the center of the semicircle in the figure above.

		<title>Solenoid</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Consider the magnetic field created by an infinitely long solenoid with radius <m>R</m> and <m>n</m> coils per unit length carrying a steady clockwise current <m>I</m>. Starting from the assumption that the magnetic field everywhere in space must point in either the positive or negative <m>z</m>-direction (parallel to the axis of the solenoid), use Ampere's Law to determine the magnitude and direction of this magnetic field.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				You will need to choose Amperian Loops thoughtfully, and you may need more than one!
