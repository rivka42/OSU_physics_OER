	<p>Bar magnets have a physical property called the magnetic dipole moment.</p>
	
	<definition>
		<title>Magnetic Dipole Moment</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>magnetic dipole moment</term>, <m>\vec{\mu}</m>, points from the south to the north pole inside a bar magnet.</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>
	
	<p>The magnetic field around a simple magnetic dipole has the form shown below.</p>
