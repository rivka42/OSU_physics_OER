	<p>Magnets interact in lots of interesting ways with different types of materials. We will discuss mainly permanent magnets and ferromagnetic objects.</p>

		<title>Permanent magnets</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p><term>Permanent magnets</term> are objects that have both attractive and repulsive interactions with each other. These objects have a ``north" and a ``south" pole that react to each other in different ways. Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.</p>

	<definition>
		<title>Ferromagnetic magnets</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p><term>Ferromagnetic</term> materials (like iron, cobalt, and nickel) tend to be attracted to permanent magnets<fn>ferromagmetic materials can become permanent magnets through a process known as magnetization</fn>.</p>
