				Shown above is a cross-sectional view of two long straight wires that are parallel to one another.  One wire carries a current <m>i_o</m> out of the page; the other carries an equal current <m>i_o</m> into the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppose a third wire (carrying the same current <m>i_o</m> out of the page) is placed such that the magnetic field at point <m>P</m> has zero magnitude.  Determine the location of the third wire.

				A very long half-cylinder of radius <m>R</m> (see picture above) carries a total current <m>I</m> uniformly distributed across the circumference.  Determine the magnetic field along the central axis of the cylinder.

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				Review activities you completed when you were studying electric fields. You can start with Chapters 21 and 22. Find two activities related to electric fields that are similar to the activities you completed this week for your challenge homework. Discuss the main similarities and differences.
