				Shown above is a cross-sectional view of two long straight wires that are parallel to one another.  One wire carries a current <m>i_o</m> out of the page; the other carries an equal current <m>i_o</m> into the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppose a third wire (carrying the same current <m>i_o</m> out of the page) is placed such that the magnetic field at point <m>P</m> has zero magnitude.  Determine the location of the third wire.
