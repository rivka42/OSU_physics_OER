	<p>The circuit above contains a capacitor and an inductor.  The capacitor is initially charged (positive on the top and negative on the bottom).</p>
		<exercise>
			<p>When the switch is closed, the initial current through the inductor is 0 A.  Give a physical reason for why you think this happens.</p>
