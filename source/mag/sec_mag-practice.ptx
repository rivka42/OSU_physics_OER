			<title>Magnets in a Magnetic Field</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					You have two cylindrical bar magnets with the same mass, length, and dipole moment, but different moments of inertia, <m>I_1</m> and <m>I_2</m>.  You place each bar magnet so that it is initially oriented perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field.  When you let each bar magnet go from rest, you find that magnet 1 takes less time than magnet 2 to rotate so that it is parallel to the magnetic field.  Is <m>I_1</m> greater than, less than, or equal to <m>I_2</m>?

			<title>Magnetic Field from Three Wires</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Three wires carry the same current <m>I_o</m> out of the page.  The wires are located at different points along the <m>x</m>-axis: at <m>x = -L</m>, at <m>x = 0</m>, and at <m>x = +L</m>.  Determine the magnetic field a distance <m>y</m> above the center wire.

			<title>Current Carrying Wires</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The two wires shown below carry the same current in opposite directions.  You observe a proton at each of the marked points moving upward with the same speed.  (Each marked point is the same distance from its nearest wire.)  Rank the three points by the magnitude of the magnetic force that the proton experiences, and indicate the direction of the magnetic force in each case.

			<title>Current Loop on a Table</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A circular loop of wire lies horizontally on the surface of a table. The wire carries current flowing counter-clockwise, as viewed from above.

In what direction is the net magnetic field at a location midway between the loop's center and the permanent magnet?

			<title>Electromagnet</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					An electromagnet is created by coiling a single wire into a set of identical loops and then sending a current along the wire. (You can try this with a 9-V battery, some wire, and a nail to wrap it around.) What advantage does an electromagnet have that a permanent magnet does not have?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					Its magnetism can be made stronger or weaker by changing the current.

			<title>Current-Carrying Wires</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Two current-carrying wires are parallel to each other. Then the current in one is increased by a factor of 2, the current in the other is increased by a factor of 3, and the distance between the wires is decreased by a factor of 1/3. How does this change the force magnitude exerted by one wire on the other?

			<title>Antimatter Drive</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Viewers of Star Trek hear of an antimatter drive on the Starship Enterprise.  One possibility for such a futuristic energy source is to store charged antimatter particles in a vacuum chamber, circulating in a magnetic field, then extract them as needed.  (Antimatter annihilates with normal matter, producing pure energy.)  What strength magnetic field is needed to hold antiprotons that are moving at <m>5.00 \times 10^7</m> m/s in a circular path 2.00 m in radius?  (Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but are negatively charged.)
