		<title>Current Carrying Wire</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A very long, straight segment of current-carrying wire is oriented vertically.  This current-carrying wire creates a magnetic field that points into the page on the right hand side of the wire, and out of the page on the left hand side of the wire.  What is the direction of current in this wire?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				Upward.

		<title>Current Loop on a Table</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A circular loop of wire lies horizontally on the surface of a table. The wire carries current flowing counter-clockwise, as viewed from above. A permanent magnet, oriented perpendicular to the table with its south pole closest to the table, is placed directly above the loop's center. In what direction is the net magnetic field at a location midway between the loop's center and the permanent magnet?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				Upward, away from the table.

		<title>Electromagnet</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				An electromagnet is created by coiling a single wire into a set of identical loops and then sending a current along the wire. (You can try this with a 9-V battery, some wire, and a nail to wrap it around.) What advantage does an electromagnet have that a permanent magnet does not have?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				Its magnetism can be made stronger or weaker by changing the current.

		<title>Current-Carrying Wires</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Two current-carrying wires are parallel to each other. Then the current in one is increased by a factor of 2, the current in the other is increased by a factor of 3, and the distance between the wires is decreased by a factor of 1/3. How does this change the force magnitude exerted by one wire on the other?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<answer>
			<p>
				It increases by a factor of 18.

		<title>Antimatter Drive</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Viewers of Star Trek hear of an antimatter drive on the Starship Enterprise.  One possibility for such a futuristic energy source is to store charged antimatter particles in a vacuum chamber, circulating in a magnetic field, then extract them as needed.  (Antimatter annihilates with normal matter, producing pure energy.)  What strength magnetic field is needed to hold antiprotons that are moving at <m>5.00 \times 10^7</m> m/s in a circular path 2.00 m in radius?  (Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but are negatively charged.)

		</statement>
		<answer>

				0.261 T
