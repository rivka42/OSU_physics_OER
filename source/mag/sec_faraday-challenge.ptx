		<title>Charging your Phone</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				You have a circular coil of radius 25 cm with 200 turns and resistance 5 <m>\Omega</m> that you would like to use to generate some power for charging your phone. You look up and see that 9 m above you is a long, straight power line that you estimate has a maximum current of 700 A alternating at 50 Hz. Estimate the maximum current through your coil.

			<p>
				Shown below is a circuit with an ideal battery, a linear resistor, and an ideal inductor. This circuit has been connected for a very long time (with the switch open), and you measure the current through the inductor to be <m>I_A</m>. At time <m>t_1</m>, you close the switch. You then wait a long time and measure the current through the inductor to be <m>I_B</m>. Is <m>I_B</m> greater than, less than, or equal to <m>I_A</m>?

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Inductors and capacitors can both act as a voltage source in circuits. Compare and contrast inductors and capacitors. When can both elements act as a voltage source? As part of your comparison, include important equations for both circuit elements.
