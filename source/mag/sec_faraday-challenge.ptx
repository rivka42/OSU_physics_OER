		<title>Circuit I</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The switch in the circuit above has been closed for a very long time. At the instant you flip the switch to the right, what is the current through the inductor? At the same instant, what is the absolute value of the voltage across the inductor?

		<title>Square Loop in a Magnetic Field</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A square loop of wire with side length 6 cm and resistance 0.4 <m>\Omega</m> is in a uniform magnetic field <m>B = -0.008t^2</m> (in Tesla) that points in the <m>z</m>-direction (through the loop). Determine the current induced in the loop as a function of time (both magnitude and direction).

		<title>Charging your Phone</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				You have a circular coil of radius 25 cm with 200 turns and resistance 5 <m>\Omega</m> that you would like to use to generate some power for charging your phone. You look up and see that 9 m above you is a long, straight power line that you estimate has a maximum current of 700 A alternating at 50 Hz. Estimate the maximum current through your coil.

		<title>Circuit II</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Shown below is a circuit with an ideal battery, a linear resistor, and an ideal inductor. This circuit has been connected for a very long time (with the switch open), and you measure the current through the inductor to be <m>I_A</m>. At time <m>t_1</m>, you close the switch. You then wait a long time and measure the current through the inductor to be <m>I_B</m>. Is <m>I_B</m> greater than, less than, or equal to <m>I_A</m>?
