		<statement>
			<p><term>Ampere's Law</term> relates the net magnetic field around a closed curved to the current passing through the region bounded by the curve: <me>\bigcirc \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int_S \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_o I_{enclosed}</me></p>

			<p>Shown below are three different cases, each with two identical current-carrying wires and a circular Amperian loop.  In which case is the net magnetic field around the loop the largest?</p>

				<image source="mag/Ampo.png" width = "100%" ><description>Three boxes sit side by side. The lefthand box is case A, where one wire sits inside a closed Amperian loop and another wire sits outside the loop. The middle box shows case B, where both wires sit outside the loop. The righthand box shows case C where both wires sit inside the loop.</description></image>
