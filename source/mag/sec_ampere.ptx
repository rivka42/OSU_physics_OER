			<p>Shown below is a bar magnet and a loop with current that is running clockwise when viewed from above. Describe what you expect to happen to the bar magnet and the loop as time progresses.</p>

		<statement>
			<p><term>Ampere's Law</term> says that the net magnetic field around a closed curved is proportional to the current passing through the region bounded by the curve: <me>\bigcirc \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int_S \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_o I_{enclosed}</me></p>

			<p>Shown below are three different cases, each with two identical current-carrying wires and a circular Amperian loop.In which case is the net magnetic field around the loop the largest?</p>
			<figure xml:id="ampere">
				<caption>Three cases are shown depicting an Amperian loop (dashed line) and different wires.</caption>
				<image source="mag/Ampo.png" width = "90%" ><description>Three boxes sit side by side. The lefthand box is case A, where one wire sits inside a closed Amperian loop and another wire sits outside the loop. The middle box shows case B, where both wires sit outside the loop. The righthand box shows case C where both wires sit inside the loop.</description></image>
