	<p>Based on what you discovered in the previous section, you can define the force that a magnetic field exerts on a moving charge to be <me>\vec{F}^B = q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}</me> where <m>\vec{B}</m> is the magnetic field, <m>q</m> is the charge experiencing the force, and <m>\vec{v}</m> is the velocity of the charge experiencing the force.  When added to the force on a charge by an electric force, you arrive at the full expression for force in electromagnetism, which is known as the Lorentz Force.</p>

		<title>Lorentz Force</title>
		<statement>
			<p>The <term>Lorentz Force</term> is defined as the sum of the electric and magnetic forces on a charge <me>\vec{F} = q\vec{E} + q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}</me></p>

		<title>Activities</title>
		<p>In <xref ref="x_magnetic-field"/>, you determined the magnetic field due to a long, straight current.  Assume a small positive charge is currently located at each of the four marked points, moving downward with known speed <m>v</m>.</p>
		<exercise>
			<p>For each point, draw a vector representing the magnetic force on the moving charge.</p>
		</exercise>
		<exercise>
			<p>Determine the magnitude of the force in each case.</p>
