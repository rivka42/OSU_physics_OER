  	<title>Chop-Multiply-Add: Calculating Magnetic Fields</title>

	<p>For a continuous current density, you can use the <alert>Chop-Multiply-Add</alert> strategy to construct and evaluate an integral for the magnetic field, similar to the strategy in <xref ref="sec_calculating-e"/>.  The overall strategy for the magnetic field above the middle of a strip of total current <m>I</m> that is infinite in the <m>x</m>-direction (with width <m>L</m> in the <m>y</m>-direction) is given below.</p>
	
	<p><term>Chop:</term> You can start by chopping up the strip into wires.  Each wire carries infinitesimal current <m>\vec{dI} = \frac{I}{L} dy \hat{x}</m>, where the <m>dy</m> represents an infinitesimal length.</p>
	
	<p><term>Multiply:</term> Once you know the current carried by each small wire <m>dI</m>, you <em>multiply</em> to find the magnetic field created by that small wire: <m>d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_o}{4\pi}\frac{\vec{dI} \times \hat{r}}{r^2} = \frac{\mu_o I}{4\pi L}\frac{\hat{x} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}dy</m>.  Here <m>r</m> is the distance from the location of <m>\vec{dI}</m> to the location where you are evaluating the magnetic field, and <m>\hat{r}</m> is the unit vector that points in this direction.  It can be highly useful to draw a diagram of the current, including an example <m>\vec{dI}</m>, and label <m>r</m> and <m>\hat{r}</m> so they can be easily written in terms of your chosen coordinates.  This is especially useful for calculating the cross product.</p>
	
	<p><term>Add:</term> Last, once you have the infinitesimal <m>d\vec{B}</m>, you <em>add</em> together every <m>d\vec{B}</m> over the entire object: <me>\vec{B} = \int d\vec{B}</me></p>
