		After successful completion of this chapter, you will be able to:
		<ol>
			<li>Relate the capacitance of a circuit to the stored charge and the electric potential difference.</li>
<li>Determine the energy stored in a capacitor.</li>
<li>Determine the equivalent capacitance of a circuit.</li>
<li>Identify the conditions for current to flow through circuit components.</li>
<li>Relate current to the flow of electric charge per unit time.</li>
<li>Draw and label basic and advanced circuit diagrams.</li>
<li>Treat batteries as sources of constant voltage rather than constant current.</li>
<li>Determine the amount of current flowing through a circuit with one or more resistors and a single battery, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</li>
<li>Determine the amount of current flowing through a circuit with one or more resistors and more than one battery, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</li>
<li>Determine the equivalent resistance of a circuit.</li>
<li>Determine the power and/or energy used by a resistor.</li>
<li>Use Kirchoffâ€™s Laws to quantify the behavior of a complicated circuit.</li>
<li>Describe the behavior of simple RC circuits qualitatively and quantitatively.</li>
