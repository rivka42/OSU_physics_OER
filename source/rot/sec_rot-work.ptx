  <title>Rotational Work</title>
	
	<p>Since there is kinetic energy associated with rotation, it stands to reason that energy can be transferred into or out of a system via a rotational interaction.  In fact, you can create an angular analogue for <xref ref="def_work" text="title"></xref></p>

	<statement><p></p>
	<p>The <term>work</term> done by a torque <m>\vec{\tau}</m> on an object rotating through <m>\vec{d\theta}</m> is: <me>W = \int_{\theta_i}^{\theta_f} {\vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{d\theta}}</me> </p>
	</statement>
	</definition>

<p>As with work done by a force, if the torque is constant you can simply write <me>W = \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\Delta \theta}</me></p>

			<title>Calculation: Unwinding a Spool</title>
			<p></p>
			<p>Suppose you unwind a string that has been wrapped around a spool of radius <m>R</m> three times, causing the spool to gain a known amount of rotational kinetic energy <m>K_{rot}</m>.  Find the magnitude of the force you exerted on the string.</p>
