		<title>The Bowl</title>
		<statement>
		<p></p>
		<p>Shown below is a motion diagram of a ball rolling along a semicircular track. The time intervals between each pair of consecutive points are equal. The ball starts from rest at point 1, and just reaches point 9 before rolling back down the right side of the track. </p>

		<p>Complete this motion diagram by sketching qualitatively accurate vectors representing both (a) the instantaneous velocity and (b) the instantaneous acceleration of the ball at each instant.</p>
		
		<p>Your explanation should describe how you used the diagram to determine each vector and detail why the magnitudes of the vectors are the same or different.</p>

        <title>The Conical Bowl</title>
		<statement><p></p>
		    <p>You are riding a <m>150 \mathrm{~kg}</m> bicycle at constant speed along a circular track of radius <m>25 \mathrm{~m}</m>.  The shape of the track is a conical bowl, so the track makes a consistent angle of 15Â° with the horizontal. Determine the speed of the bicycle.</p>

		<hint>
		    <p>For your special case analysis (part 3c), try a special case using the angle of the track.</p>

    <p>
      Choose one of the major models or equations that you made use of during this unit on rotational motion.  
	  Identify the corresponding model or equation that you have used previously when studying translational motion.  
	  Write a few sentences comparing and contrasting the rotational and translational versions.
