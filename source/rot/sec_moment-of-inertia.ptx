	<p>The picture below shows two weights that have the same mass but that have that mass distributed differently.  The upper weight has most of its mass near the center.  The lower weight has most of its mass near the edges.</p>

	<p>Recall the definition of <xref ref="def_mass" text="title"></xref> as the capacity of an object to resist changes to its motion.  The rotational analogue<mdash/>the capacity of an object to resist changes to its <em>angular</em> motion<mdash/>is known as the moment of inertia.</p>

	<title>Moment of Inertia</title>
	<statement><p></p>
		<p>The <term>moment of inertia</term> of a rigid object is its capacity to resist changes to its angular motion, and can be found as a weighted average of the distance squared: <me>I = \sum_{i} m_ir_i^2</me> for a set of discrete objects and <me>I = \int r^2 dm</me> for a continuous object.</p>
	</statement>

			<exercise>
			<p>You are riding a <m>150 \mathrm{~kg}</m> bicycle at constant speed along a circular track of radius <m>25 \mathrm{~m}</m>.  What is the moment of inertia of the bicycle about the center of the track?  What assumptions do you need to make so that you do not have to do any integrals?</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<p>Suppose you want to find the moment of inertia of the lower weight from the Warm-up Activities.  What information would you need to know?  What assumptions would you want to make?  What equations would you decide to use?</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			<p>It is extremely common to use a reference to find the moments of inertia for common objects, rather than calculate them directly every time as you will do in the next section.  Use <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_moments_of_inertia" visual="this table"/> to determine the moment of inertia for each of the following:</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
			<li>A tennis ball spinning about its center</li>
			<li>A record disc spinning about its center</li>
			<li>A baton spinning about its end</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			</exercise>
