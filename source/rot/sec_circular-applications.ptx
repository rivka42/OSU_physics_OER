<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      Each of the three <m>10 \mathrm{~cm}</m> radius hands on an analog clock (hour, minute, second) can be treated as having uniform circular motion.

	<title>Uniform Circular Motion Table</title>
<introduction>
<p></p>
    <p>
      An object that is moving with uniform circular motion follows a path that is circular while moving with a speed that is constant.
    </p>
</introduction>
	<task>
	<p> 
		Draw a motion diagram for such an object that includes at least five different points.  Your motion diagram should include, at each point: a representation of the object, a position vector, a velocity vector, and an acceleration vector.
	</p>
	</task>
	<task>
	<p>
		Make a table with six columns:
    </p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the first (left-most) column, make a list of the following physical quantities of a particle moving around a circle at constant speed: (translational) position, (translational) velocity, (translational) acceleration, mass, net force, (translational) kinetic energy, and (translational) momentum.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the second column indicate if the quantity is a scalar or a vector.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the third column indicate if the quantity is constant or not constant.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the fourth column write the units for the quantity.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the fifth column write a symbolic definition of the quantity.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				In the sixth column, if the quantity is a vector, then write what is known about its direction.
