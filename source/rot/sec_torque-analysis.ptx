<p>The force analysis you studied in <xref ref="sec_solving-forces1"></xref> and <xref ref="sec_solving-forces2"></xref> can now be extended to include torque.</p>

<p><alert>Understanding:</alert> Identify all relevant systems and draw an Extended Free-body Diagram for each.</p>

<p><alert>Calculating:</alert> Is the acceleration of each system <m>0 \text{ m/s^2}</m> (static or dynamic equilibrium) or not <m>0 \text{ m/s^2}</m> (dynamics)?  What about the angular acceleration?  Once you know, use the Law of Motion, the Angular Law of Motion, and any action/reaction pairs between any interacting systems.</p>

<p><alert>Sensemaking:</alert> All the sensemaking strategies you have will work, including Special-case Analysis (see <xref ref="sec_special-cases"/>), especially for special cases that reduce the context to one in which there is no rotational motion.</p>

			<title>Real-world Context - The Tree Branch</title>
	<p>Suppose you are taking a walk one day when you see a tree branch snap at its base and begin to rotate downward with the break near the trunk of the tree as a pivot point.   You estimate the length of the branch to be about 3 meters.</p>
			<exercise>
			  <p>What expression do you think you should use for the moment of inertia of the tree branch?</p>
			</exercise>
						<exercise>
			  <p>Estimate the initial angular acceleration of the branch.</p>
			</exercise>
									<exercise>
			  <p>Can you estimate the mass of the tree branch from the given information? Why or why not?</p>
			</exercise>
