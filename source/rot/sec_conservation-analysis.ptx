  <title>Conservation Analysis</title>
		
	<p>You have previously used two conservation laws: <xref ref="p_work-energy" text="title"></xref> and <xref ref="p_impulse-momentum" text="title"></xref>.  The work-energy theorem already includes rotational kinetic energy, but the impulse-momentum theorem is purely translational.  You can, however, define an angular analogue for it<fn>you could imagine calling this the Angular-Impulse-Momentum theorem, which is wordy, but most physicists talk about it as Conservation of Angular Momentum, even in situations where the angular momentum is not in fact conserved</fn>.</p>
	
	<principle xml:id="p_angular-impulse-momentum">
	<title>Conservation of Angular Momentum (The Angular Impulse-Momentum Theorem)</title>
	<statement>
	  <p>The net angular impulse delivered to a system is equal to the change in angular momentum for that system: <me>\vec{\tau}_{net}\Delta t = \Delta \vec{L}</me></p>
	</statement>
	</principle>

<p>Even though this expression looks very similar to the impulse-momentum theorem, it is entirely separate!  This suggests that angular momentum can be conserved (or not conserved) independent of whether translational momentum is conserved (or not).  Additionally, translational momentum can never be converted into angular momentum (though the same thing is not true for translational and angular kinetic energy).</p>

			<exercise>
			<statement>
			<p>What is the condition that must be met for the angular momentum of a system to be conserved?</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
			<p>If angular momentum is conserved then <m>\Delta \vec{L} = 0</m>; this can only be true if <m>\vec{\tau}_{net} = 0</m> as well.</p>
