	<p>Precession refers to a type of motion in which a torque on a rotating object causes the <em>direction</em> of the axis of rotation to change, rather than causing the object's rotation to speed up or slow down.</p>

	<exercise>
	<p>Recall what you learned about tangential and centripetal acceleration for an object moving around a circle.  What change does the centripetal acceleration cause to the object's velocity?  What change does the tangential acceleration cause?  Compare the direction of each acceleration to the direction of the object's instantaneous velocity as it moves around the circle.</p>

	<p>See if you can make an analogy between circular motion and precessional motion.  What must be true about the direction of the net torque on an object for it to undergo precession?</p>
