	<title>Warm-up Activity: The Meter Stick</title>
			
			<p></p>
		<p> You want to find the center of mass for a meter stick that has a total mass of <m>0.15 \mathrm{~kg}</m>.</p>
		<exercise>
			<title>Orient</title>
			<statement>
			<p></p>
			<p>Explain why the integral below will give the length of the meter stick.  Given this expression, where is the meter stick located?
				<me>\int_{0}^{1 \mathrm{~m}} dx</me>
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					This integral gives the length of the board, because you are integrating over <m>x</m>. The result of this integral is <m>1 \mathrm{~m}</m>. The board is located with one end at the origin, and the other end at <m>x = 1 \mathrm{~m}</m>. 
				</p>
			</solution>

						<title>Chop</title>
						<statement>
						<p></p>
			<p>You decide to chop up the meter stick into small pieces with infinitesimal width <m>dx</m>, each of which has infinitesimal mass <m>dm</m>.  Sketch and label a diagram of the meter stick showing both <m>dx</m> and <m>dm</m>.</p>

						</solution>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
				<title>Multiply</title>
				<statement>
				<p></p>
			<p>An infinitesimal piece of the meter stick <m>dx</m> and the corresponding mass of that piece <m>dm</m> are related by the linear mass density <m>\lambda</m>: <me>dm = \lambda dx</me>.  Calculate the density under the assumption that the density is uniform throughout the meter stick.</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						 The linear mass density can be written as <m>\lambda=\frac{dm}{dx}</m>.  For a uniform mass density, this reduces to <m>\lambda = M_{total} / L_{total}</m>.  The density only reduces to the total mass over the total length when the density is uniform. So the linear mass density is: <me>\lambda = \frac{M_{total}}{L_{total}} = \frac{0.15 \mathrm{~kg}}{1 \mathrm{~m}} = 0.15 \mathrm{~kg/m}</me>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</exercise>
					<exercise>
						<title>Add</title>
						<statement>
						<p></p>
			<p>Use an integral to determine the mass of the meter stick.</p>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
								You can determine the mass of the board by integrating both sides of <m>dm = \lambda dx</m>:
								<me>
									\int_{0}^{M} dm  = \int_{0}^{L} \lambda dx
								</me>
								<me>
									M = \lambda L
								</me>
								<me>
									M = (0.15 \mathrm{~kg/m})(1 \mathrm{~m}) = 0.15 \mathrm{~kg}
								</me>
								
							</p>
						</solution>

	<statement><p></p>
		<p>The <term>center of mass</term> for a continuous system can be calculated as the average position of all parts of the object weighted by the mass at that position: <me>\vec{r}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \int \vec{r} dm</me></p>
