		<title>Friction on a Baseball</title>

		<title>String Around a Tennis Ball</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>A string is wrapped many times around a tennis ball that has mass <m>m = 60 \mathrm{~g}</m> and radius <m>r = 7 \mathrm{~cm}</m>.  For a hollow ball, <m>I = \frac{2}{3}mr^2</m> about the center or <m>I = \frac{5}{3}mr^2</m> about the edge.  The string is attached to the ceiling and the ball is allowed to fall (see the figure below). Determine the tension in the string.</p>

				There are only two forces acting on the ball: the gravitational force with magnitude <m>mg</m> and the tension force with unknown magnitude <m>F^T</m>.  The ball accelerates downward, so the net force should also point downward, leading to the conclusion that the gravitational force is larger than the tension force.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Rotational Law of Motion for an axis passing through the place where the string is in contact with the ball: <me>
					\vec{\tau}_{net} = I\vec{\alpha}
				</me>
				<me>
					mgr = \frac{5}{3}mr^2\frac{a}{r}
				</me>
				<me>
					a = \frac{3}{5}g
				</me>
				
				Now using the regular Law of Motion (with negative, downward acceleration): 
				<me>
					F^T - mg = -ma
				</me>
				<me>
					F^T = \frac{2}{5}mg
				</me>
				Plugging in the given numbers gives: 
				<me>
					F^T = 0.24 \mathrm{~N}
				</me>

			<p>Suppose you were to drop another tennis ball with the same mass and radius as in the previous activity, but a smaller moment of inertia (this tennis ball might be solid instead of hollow). Is the magnitude of the translational acceleration of the new tennis ball <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the magnitude of the translational acceleration of the original tennis ball?</p>

		<title>Torque</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>
				A force is applied on a lever arm <m>1 \mathrm{~m}</m> away from the pivot point, and it produces torque.

Assume that both forces are applied perpendicularly to the lever arm.
