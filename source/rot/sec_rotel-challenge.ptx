        <title>Spool Competition</title>
		<statement><p></p>
		    <p>You and your friend are in a competition to see which spool will reach the top of a frictionless ramp first. There are two spools: One spool has a thread wrapped many times around it so that as it is pulled up the ramp, it will rotate, and the other spool has a thread fixed at one point so that it will not rotate. Assume the thread is ideal and you and your friend can pull with the same tension.</p>
			<p>
				Part A: Which spool do you want to choose in order to win?
			</p>
			<p>
				Part B: If instead the competition was about which spool has the most energy at the top of the ramp, would you choose a different spool?

        <title>Brick on a Disc</title>
		<statement><p></p>
		    <p>A <m>100 \mathrm{~kg}</m> disc with radius <m>1.6 \mathrm{~m}</m> is spinning horizontally at <m>25 \mathrm{~rad/s}</m>.  You place a <m>20 \mathrm{~kg}</m> brick quickly and gently on the disc so that it sticks to the edge of the disc.  Determine the final angular speed of the disc-brick system.  Discuss whether the kinetic energy of the system <em>increases</em>, <em>decreases</em>, or <em>remains the same.</em></p>

		<title>Models</title>

<p>You have now finished adapting your model for motion to include rotational motion.  Consider again the questions from <xref ref="fig_applications"></xref>.  Considering specifically the process of adapting your model to include rotational motion, are your answers to these questions different than they were when you began this process?</p>
