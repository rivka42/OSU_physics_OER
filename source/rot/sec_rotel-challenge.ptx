        <title>Spool Competition</title>
		<statement><p></p>
		    <p>You and your friend are in a competition to see which spool will reach the top of a frictionless ramp first. There are two spools: One spool has a thread wrapped many times around it so that as it is pulled up the ramp, it will rotate, and the other spool has a thread fixed at one point so that it will not rotate. Assume the thread is ideal and you and your friend can pull with the same tension.</p>
			<p>
				Part A: Which spool do you want to choose in order to win?
			</p>
			<p>
				Part B: If instead the competition was about which spool has the most energy at the top of the ramp, would you choose a different spool?

        <title>Brick on a Disc</title>
		<statement><p></p>
		    <p>A <m>100 \mathrm{~kg}</m> disc with radius <m>1.6 \mathrm{~m}</m> is spinning horizontally at <m>25 \mathrm{~rad/s}</m>.  You place a <m>20 \mathrm{~kg}</m> brick quickly and gently on the disc so that it sticks to the edge of the disc.  Determine the final angular speed of the disc-brick system.</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>Discuss whether the kinetic energy of the system <em>increases</em>, <em>decreases</em>, or <em>remains the same.</em></hint>

		<title>The Merry-Go-Round I</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>You are standing at the edge of a merry-go-round at the playground.  You and the merry-go-round have about the same mass, and you can treat the merry-go-round as a solid disc with moment of inertia <m>I = \frac{1}{2}mR^2</m>, where <m>R</m> is the radius. The merry-go-round is initially spinning with constant angular speed <m>\omega_i</m>.  You decide to jump off the merry-go-round; you jump in a horizontal plane tangent to its edge.</p>
			<p>The merry-go-round comes to a complete stop.  What is your speed immediately after leaving the merry-go-round?</p>
		</statement>

	<investigation xml:id="pa_rot-12">
		<title>The Merry-Go-Round II</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>Consider the system of both you and the merry-go-round from the previous activity. Did the kinetic energy of this system <em>increase</em>, <em>decrease</em>, or <em>stay the same</em> as a result of you jumping off?</p>
