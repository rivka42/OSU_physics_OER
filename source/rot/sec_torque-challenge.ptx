		<title>Standing on a Ramp</title>

		<p>You are standing at rest on the ramp shown in the figure below.  
		Is the magnitude of the normal force acting on your bottom foot <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> 
		the magnitude of the normal force acting on your top foot?</p>

		    <p><alert><!--REPLACE_TAG-->Tip:</alert> A relevant representation is often helpful in both constructing and communicating your explanation.  For a situation like this one, try using an extended free-body diagram to help guide your reasoning.</p>

		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Once you have drawn an extended free-body diagram, a good starting point is the fundamental physical law relating torques and angular acceleration.

		    <p>Two massive blocks are shown in the figure below, connected to each other by a rope over a pulley with nonzero mass. Find the acceleration of both masses and of the pulley.</p>

				<alert><!--REPLACE_TAG-->Tip:</alert> For your representation (part 1c), sketch and label free-body diagrams for each object.  When you choose a coordinate system for each object, make sure to describe the direction of the acceleration for each object using that coordinate system.

		    <p><alert><!--REPLACE_TAG-->Tip:</alert> In this situation, your free-body diagrams can help support your calculation, espeically in part 2a.  For each free-body diagram, try to find an equation (or more than one) that quantitatively relates known quantities and unknown quantities.</p>
		</assemblage>
		<assemblage>
		    <p><alert><!--REPLACE_TAG-->Tip:</alert> For your symbolic sensemaking (part 3c), use special-case analysis and the fact that you may have solved this problem previously when the pulley is massless.

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<p></p>
    <p>
      Choose an object from your everyday experience, different from any of the situations you encountered so far in physics, that has at least one non-zero torque (it can have many, and the net torque can even be zero) and give a brief description of all the forces and torques on it.  Sketch a free-body diagram for the object and explain how your diagram is consistent with both the Law of Motion and the Angular Law of Motion.
