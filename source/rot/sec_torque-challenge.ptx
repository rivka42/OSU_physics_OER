		<p>You are standing at rest on the ramp shown in the figure below.  
		Is the magnitude of the normal force acting on your bottom foot <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em>

		<statement><p></p>
		    <p>Two massive blocks are shown in the figure below, connected to each other by a rope over a pulley with nonzero mass. Find the acceleration of both masses and of the pulley.</p>

		<title>Metacognitive Reflection</title>
		<p></p>
    <p>
      Choose an object from your everyday experience, different from any of the situations you encountered so far in physics, that has at least one non-zero torque (it can have many, and the net torque can even be zero) and give a brief description of all the forces and torques on it.  Sketch a free-body diagram for the object and explain how your diagram is consistent with both the Law of Motion and the Angular Law of Motion.
