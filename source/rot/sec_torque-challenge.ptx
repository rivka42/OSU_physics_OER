		<title>Tipping Truck</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>You observe a truck driving along a road at a constant speed <m>v</m>.  As the truck begins to turn along a flat, circular part of the road, it also begins to tip over.  Use an extended free body diagram to explain why the truck begins to tip.</p>

		<title>String Around a Tennis Ball</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>A string is wrapped many times around a tennis ball that has mass <m>m = 60 \mathrm{~g}</m> and radius <m>r = 7 \mathrm{~cm}</m>.  For a hollow ball, <m>I = \frac{2}{3}mr^2</m> about the center or <m>I = \frac{5}{3}mr^2</m> about the edge â€” calculating these for yourself is a good challenge!  The string is attached to the ceiling and the ball is allowed to fall (see the figure below). Determine the tension in the string.</p>

		<title>String Around a Tennis Ball II</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>Suppose you were to drop another tennis ball with the same mass and radius as in the previous problem, but a smaller moment of inertia (this tennis ball might be solid instead of hollow). Is the magnitude of the translational acceleration of the new tennis ball <em>greater than</em>, <em>less than</em>, or <em>equal to</em> the magnitude of the translational acceleration of the original tennis ball?</p>
