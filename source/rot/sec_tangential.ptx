	<title>Tangential Acceleration</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>tangential acceleration</term> of an object, <m>a_t</m>, points parallel to the instantaneous velocity, in the same direction if the object is speeding up and in the opposite direction if the object is slowing down.</p>
	</statement>
