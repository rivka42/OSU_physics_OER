		<title>The Merry-Go-Round I</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>The Sun has mass <m>2 \times 10^{30}  \mathrm{~kg}</m>, radius <m>7\times 10^{5} \mathrm{~km}</m>, and rotational period of approximately 28 days. If the Sun should collapse into a white dwarf of radius <m>3.5 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~km}</m>, what would its period be if no mass were ejected and a sphere of uniform density can model the Sun both before and after?</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				For this system, angular momentum is conserved since there will be no torque that acts on the system. This means the initial angular momentum equals the final angular momentum: <m>L_i = L_f</m>.  You can use the moment of inertia of a solid uniform sphere, and relate the angular speed to the period of the rotation: <me>\frac{2}{5} M_s R_s ^2 (\frac{2\pi}{T_s}) = \frac{2}{5} M_s R_n ^2 (\frac{2\pi}{T_n})</me>
				Solving for the new time: <me>T_n = T_s \frac{R_n^2}{R_s^2} = (28 \ \mathrm{~days})\frac{(3.5\times10^3)^2}{(7\times10^5)^2} = 0.0007 \ \mathrm{~days} = 60.5 \mathrm{~s}</me>

		<title>The Merry-Go-Round I</title>
		<statement><p></p>
			<p>You are standing at the edge of a merry-go-round at the playground.  You and the merry-go-round have about the same mass, and you can treat the merry-go-round as a solid disc with moment of inertia <m>I = \frac{1}{2}mR^2</m>, where <m>R</m> is the radius. The merry-go-round is initially spinning with constant angular speed <m>\omega_i</m>.  You decide to jump off the merry-go-round; you jump in a horizontal plane tangent to its edge.</p>
			<p>The merry-go-round comes to a complete stop.  What is your speed immediately after leaving the merry-go-round?</p>
