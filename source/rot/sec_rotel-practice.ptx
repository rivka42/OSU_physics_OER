				A typical small rescue helicopter has four blades. Each blade is <m>4.0 \mathrm{~m}</m> long and has a mass of <m>50.0 \mathrm{~kg}</m>. The blades can be approximated as thin rods that rotate about one end of an axis perpendicular to their length. The helicopter has a total loaded mass of <m>1000 \mathrm{~kg}</m>. Calculate the rotational kinetic energy in the blades when they rotate at <m>300 \mathrm{~rpm}</m>.
