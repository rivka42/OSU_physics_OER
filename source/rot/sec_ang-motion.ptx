      <video youtube="qMJK_sjdUCw"><description>Introducing angular motion.</description></video>
	
	<p>An object moving around a circle is an especially common form of two-dimensional motion.  Instead of using Cartesian coordinates, circular polar coordinates (usually labeled <m>r</m> for the radial distance and <m>\theta</m> for the angular distance) would make a natural alternate choice to describe such motion.	 Because the radius is constant for circular motion, this choice turns a two-dimensional context where both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are changing into a one-dimensional context where only <m>\theta</m> is changing.</p>

	<title>Angular Position</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>angular position</term> of an object moving around a circle measures the location of the object as an angle from some fixed axis (by default, the positive horizontal axis): measured in radians, it is given by <m>\theta = \frac{s}{r}</m>, where <m>s</m> is the arc length and <m>r</m> is the radius.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>
	
	<p>Using polar coordinates, <m>\theta</m> can be thought of as the <alert>angular position</alert> of an object moving around a circle; here, <m>\theta</m> is an <term>analogue</term> for the translational position <m>\vec{r}</m> with which you are already familiar.  The other motion quantities you have studied<mdash/>velocity and acceleration<mdash/>also have angular equivalents as defined below.</p>

	<definition>
	<title>Angular Velocity</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>angular velocity</term> of an object moving around a circle is given by <m>\vec{\omega} = \frac{d \vec{\theta}}{d t}</m>.  Combining this with the definition of angular position allows you to relate angular and tangential velocity as <m>\omega = \frac{v_t}{r}</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	<definition>
	<title>Angular Acceleration</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>angular acceleration</term> of an object moving around a circle is given by <m>\vec{\alpha} = \frac{d \vec{\omega}}{d t}</m>.  Combining this with the definition of angular position allows you to relate angular and tangential acceleration as <m>\alpha = \frac{a_t}{r}</m>.</p>
	</statement>

	<title>Activity - Units</title>
	<p>Angular position is virtually always measured using radians.  Other choices, such as degrees, introduce additional units that typically need to be converted to radians when working with other quantities.</p>
			<exercise>
			<statement>
			  <p>Use the definition of angular position to find the units of radians in terms of other units you are familiar with.</p>
				</statement>
				<answer>
				<p>Both <m>s</m> and <m>r</m> are measured using the same units (probably meters), so when you divide them the units of <m>\theta</m> vanish!  This means that radians have no units at all<mdash/>which is why they are preferred for angular measurements.</p>
				</answer>
			</exercise>
						<exercise>
						<statement>
			  <p>Determine the units of angular velocity and angular acceleration.</p>
				</statement>
				<answer>
				<p>rad/s and rad/s<m>^2</m></p>
				</answer>
			</exercise>

	<p>As with translational motion quantities, the angular motion quantities are vectors, with both magnitude and direction.  For straightforward examples of angular motion in which the axis of rotation<fn>the line passing through the center of the circle perpendicular to the plane of the circle</fn> does not change, the direction may often be summarized as clockwise or counterclockwise, but the true direction of the angular motion quantities is along the axis of rotation.</p>
				
				<lemma xml:id="rep_angular-vectors">
			<title>Direction of Angular Vectors</title>
			<statement>
				<p>The direction of an angular vector points along the axis of rotation.  For an object moving in the <m>xy</m>-plane, the vector pointing outward (in the <m>+z</m>-direction) corresponds to counterclockwise while the vector pointing inward (in the <m>-z</m>-direction) corresponds to clockwise.</p>
			</statement>

	<title>Activities - Circling Helicopter</title>
	<p>A helicopter is flying in a horizontal circle of radius 50 m with an initial angular velocity of 200 rad/s upward.</p>
			<exercise>
			  <p>When viewed from above, is the helicopter moving clockwise or counterclockwise?</p>

						<exercise>
			  <p>How long does it take for the helicopter to complete three full rotations?</p>

			  <p>What is the helicopter's tangential speed?</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Suppose the helicopter begins slowing down with an angular acceleration that has a magnitude of <m>20 \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}^2}</m>.  What is the helicopter's angular acceleration (magnitude and direction!)?</p>
