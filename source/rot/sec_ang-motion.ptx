	<p>An object moving around a circle is an especially common form of two-dimensional motion.  Because the radius is constant for circular motion, it is often more convenient to use <em>angular motion quantities</em> than translational motion quantities.  This is essentially equivalent to using circular polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates to describe the motion.  Each of the three primary motion quantities---position, velocity, and acceleration---has an angular equivalent, defined below.</p>
		
	<definition>
	<title>Angular Position</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>angular position</term> of an object moving around a circle is <m>\theta = \frac{s}{r}</m>, where <m>s</m> is the arc length and <m>r</m> is the radius.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	<definition>
	<title>Angular Velocity</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>angular velocity</term> of an object moving around a circle is given by <m>\vec{\omega} = \frac{d \vec{\theta}}{d t}</m>.  Combining this with the definition of angular position allows you to relate angular and tangential velocity as <m>\omega = \frac{v_t}{r}</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	<definition>
	<title>Angular Acceleration</title>
	<statement>
		<p>The <term>angular acceleration</term> of an object moving around a circle is given by <m>\vec{\alpha} = \frac{d \vec{\omega}}{d t}</m>.  Combining this with the definition of angular position allows you to relate angular and tangential acceleration as <m>\alpha = \frac{a_t}{r}</m>.</p>
	</statement>
</definition>

	<p>As with translational motion quantities, the angular motion quantities are vectors, with both magnitude and direction.  For straightforward examples of angular motion in which the axis of rotation<fn>the line passing through the center of the circle perpendicular to the plane of the circle</fn> does not change, the direction may often be summarized as clockwise or counterclockwise, but the true direction of the angular motion quantities is along the axis of rotation.</p>
				
				<lemma xml:id="rep_angular-vectors">
			<title>Direction of Angular Vectors</title>
			<statement>
				<p>The direction of an angular vector points along the axis of rotation.  For an object moving in the <m>xy</m>-plane, the vector pointing outward (in the <m>+z</m>-direction) corresponds to counterclockwise while the vector pointing inward (in the <m>-z</m>-direction) corresponds to clockwise.</p>
			</statement>

	<title>Activities - Circling Helicopter</title>
	<p>A helicopter is flying in a horizontal circle of radius 50 m with an initial angular velocity of 200 rad/s upward.</p>
			<exercise>
			  <p>When viewed from above, is the helicopter moving clockwise or counterclockwise?</p>

						<exercise>
			  <p>How long does it take for the helicopter to complete three full rotations?</p>

			  <p>What is the helicopter's tangential speed?</p>
			</exercise>
			<exercise>
			  <p>Suppose the helicopter begins slowing down with an angular acceleration that has a magnitude of <m>20 \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}^2}</m>.  What is the helicopter's angular acceleration (magnitude and direction!)?</p>
