	<p>ADD VIDEO Until now, you have been considering objects that are symmetrical, in which case the center of the object and the center of mass are at the same position.  For non-symmetrical objects, or for systems made up of multiple objects that are not arranged symmetrically, center of mass can be calculated as a weighted average.</p>

	<statement>
		<p>The single location where you may consider an extended object to be located is known as the <term>center of mass</term>.  It can be calculated as the average position of all parts of the object weighted by the mass at that position: <me>\vec{r}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i} \vec{r}_i m_i</me> for a set of discrete objects and <me>\vec{r}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \int \vec{r} dm</me> for a continuous object.</p>
