	<p>Until now, you have been considering objects that are symmetrical, in which case the geometric center of the object and the center of mass are at the same position.  For non-symmetrical objects, or for systems made up of multiple objects that are not arranged symmetrically, center of mass can be calculated as a weighted average.</p>

	<statement><p></p>
		<p>The <term>center of mass</term> for a system of discrete, pointlike objects can be calculated as the average position of all parts of the object weighted by the mass at that position: <me>\vec{r}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i} \vec{r}_i m_i</me></p>
