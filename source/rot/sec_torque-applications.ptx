	<title>The Ladder</title>
<statement>
<p></p>
    <p>
      A ladder leans against a wall, as shown in the figure below.  
	  Draw an extended free body diagram for the ladder and describe the system using the Rotational Law of Motion 
	  (Newton's 2nd Law for Rotation).

    <p>
      Two athletes are engaged in a modified game of Tug-of-War.  Each athlete has a rope that is connected to a long wooden board with mass <m>m</m> that is free to rotate about its center, as shown in the figure.

</introduction>
<task>
	<statement>
		<p>
			If the wooden board does not rotate, how does the tension from athlete A compare to the tension from athlete B?
		</p>
	</statement>
</task>
<task>
	<statement>
		<p>
			Which one will win if athlete B can exert a tension force that is 1.5 times bigger than athlete A?  Write a symbolic expression for the board's angular acceleration.
		</p>
	</statement>
	<hint>
		<p>
			Write the moment of inertia for the board in terms of given quantities by looking at a moment of inertia table.  You will need to decide what kind of object to use as a model for the board and choose an appropriate axis of rotation.
