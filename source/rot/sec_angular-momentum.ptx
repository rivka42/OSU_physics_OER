	<p>There is one last translational quantity for which you can write an angular analogue: <em>momentum</em>.  This angular analogue is known as angular momentum.</p>
	
	<definition>
	<title>Angular Momentum for a Rigid Object</title>
	<statement><p></p>
		<p>The <term>angular momentum</term> of a rigid object about a given axis is the product of the object's moment of inertia and angular velocity about that axis: <me>\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>Interestingly, it is not only rotating rigid objects that have angular momentum.  Any object with translational momentum also has angular momentum, as long as it is moving perpendicular to some axis!</p>

	<definition>
	<title>Angular Momentum for a Point Particle</title>
	<statement><p></p>
		<p>The <term>angular momentum</term> of a point particle about a given axis is the cross product between the object's position and its translational momentum: <me>\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}</me></p>
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>One especially critical feature of angular momentum (along with many other angular quantities) for a point particle is that it depends on your choice of axis.  Interestingly, the angular momentum of a rotating rigid object does not depend on your choice of axis (because it is actually rotating around a fixed axis!).</p>

			  <p>Suppose a friend of yours wrote down the following equation for something they call the <q>total momentum</q>: <m>\vec{p} + \vec{L}</m>.  How could you convince your friend that this equation is incorrect, and that there cannot be such a thing as total momentum?</p>
