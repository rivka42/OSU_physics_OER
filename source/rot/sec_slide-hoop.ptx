	<title>The Sliding Hoop</title>
<introduction>
<p> </p>
    <p>
      SA hoop with mass <m>m</m> and radius <m>r</m> is thrown to the right with initial speed <m>v_i</m> and initial angular speed <m>\omega_i</m> such that the hoop is spinning backwards (opposite the direction it would need to spin to roll without slipping).
    </p>
</introduction>
	<task>
		<statement>
	<p> 
		After observing the hoop, give a qualitative explanation, including at least one extended free-body diagram, to account for the motion of the hoop.
	</p>
</statement>
	</task>
	<task>
		<statement>
	<p>
		Calculate the distance the hoop slides before it is rolling without slipping.  Assume you know the coefficients of friction.
    </p>
</statement>
<hint>
	<p>
		Write down the Law of Motion (both translational and rotational) for the hoop and use it to calculate the amount of time the hoop travels before it rolls without slipping.
