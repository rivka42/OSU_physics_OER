  <title>Chop-Multiply-Add: Calculating Moment of Inertia</title>
		
      <video youtube="ersSAN7aFfw"><description>An example of calculating moment of inertia using integrals.</description></video>
	
	<p>For a continuous object, like a solid sphere or cylinder, the moment of inertia can be calculated using <me>I = \int r^2 dm</me>  As with previous integral expressions in physics such as those you saw in <xref ref="sec_calc1"></xref>, <xref ref="sec_work2"></xref>, and <xref ref="sec_center-of-mass"></xref>, you can use the <alert>Chop-Multiply-Add</alert> strategy to construct and evaluate any necessary integrals.</p>
	
	<p><term>Chop:</term> You can start by chopping up the object into small pieces.  Each piece of the object is represented by the expression <m>dm = \rho dV</m>, where the <m>dV</m> represents the infinitesimal volume of the piece and <m>\rho</m> is the volume mass density of the object.  In general, <m>\rho</m> can be either uniform (constant over the entire object) or non-uniform (in which case it will change from place to place).</p>
	
	<note>
	<title>Choosing Coordinates for Integrals</title>
	<p>You must always choose a set of coordinates when evaluating an integral.  It usually makes sense to choose coordinates that match the symmetry of your object or system.  For a cube, you might choose regular Cartesian coordinates <m>dV = dx dy dz</m>, while for a cylinder you might choose polar coordinates <m>dV = s ds d\phi dz</m>.  You might even decide that your object or system can be treated as two-dimensional (or even one-dimensional), in which case you do not need all three dimensions.  In any case, you will need to integrate over the entire object with respect to every relevant coordinate.</p>

	<p><term>Multiply:</term> Once you know the mass of each small piece <m>dm</m>, you <em>multiply</em> to find the moment of inertia of that small piece is: <m>dI = r^2dm = r^2 \rho dV</m>.  Here <m>r</m> is the straight-line (perpendicular) distance from the axis of rotation to the location of <m>dm</m>.  It can be highly useful to draw a diagram of the shape, including an example <m>dm</m>, and label <m>r</m> so that it can be easily written in terms of your chosen coordinates.</p>
	
		<p><term>Add:</term> Last, once you have the infinitesimal <m>dI</m>, you <em>add</em> together every <m>dI</m> over the entire object: <me>\int dI = \int r^2 dm</me></p>

	<title>Density</title>
	<p>Physicists commonly use different letters for density depending on whether it is a one-dimensional (linear), two-dimensional (surface), or three-dimensional (volume) density.  The letters typically chosen are, respectively, <m>\lambda</m> (for linear), <m>\sigma</m> (for surface), and <m>\rho</m>.  One reason for this difference is that the different densities have different units, so this makes it easier to check your units at the end!</p>

			<title>Calculate - Baton</title>
			<p></p>
			  <p>In the previous section, you looked up the moment of inertia for a baton spinning about one of its ends.  Use the Chop-Multiply-Add strategy to calculate this moment of inertia for yourself, given the mass <m>M</m> and length <m>L</m> of the baton.  For simplicity, assume the baton is one dimensional and the mass is uniformly distributed <m>\lambda = M/L</m>.</p>
